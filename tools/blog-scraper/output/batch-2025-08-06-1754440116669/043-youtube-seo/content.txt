Ways to Optimize YouTube SEO

You can never post a YouTube video without SEO. Optimizing some elements of your video before launching it online is key for winning the top rank of search engine result pages and helping you stand out in the sea of content.
Adjusting SEO on your YouTube channel and videos can make your content easily discoverable through search engines. Below we put together the 11 ways to optimize YouTube SEO.

1. Use keywords to Rename Video Files

Optimizing YouTube SEO starts even before you step into the platform. Apparently, YouTube’s algorithm doesn’t “watch” your video to check content and keywords relevance. But it can read your file names.
Renaming your video files becomes vital. You must name your video files using relevant keywords in your content. Your chosen keywords must also be integral to your video’s title, tags, and description.
You can use SEO tools to decide on potential keywords that many are looking for. Many platforms offer free and paid use of keyword tools. Some best recommendations for online keyword generators are Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz, and Google Search Console.

2. Create a Natural and KeywordsFriendly Title

The title of your video is a crucial part of attracting viewers. Plain titles won’t be enough, but exaggerated and unnatural titles are worse.
Your video title must flow naturally. Ensure that the keywords are the highlight of your video title. Consider studying your competitors’ videos to prevent similar styles when producing titles.
Pen down some points below to help you create catchy yet natural and keywordsfriendly video titles for YouTube.
 Keep your video title short by limiting up to 60 characters
 Put your main keywords at the beginning of your title
 Mention audiences’ pain points
 Use strong action verbs to encourage actions
 Make videos that relate to trending videos
 Use numbers or listicle style on your video title
 Make the title and video thumbnail relevant and work well together
Taking into account some points above helps you avoid creating clickbait titles. You should avoid clickbait titles as they can be uncomfortable to viewers and decrease your credibility as a YouTube creator.

3. Optimize Video Description

Making SEOfriendly descriptions won’t be a problem if you know the best practices. Video description plays a big role in defining your video’s success, so never leave it empty. You can provide relevant explanations or further information about your content or channel.
YouTube provides 5,000 characters or around 800 words to write video descriptions, but you don’t have to use it all. You can keep it concise by writing relevant text containing 180220 characters. Keep in mind some points below when creating video descriptions on YouTube.
 Write relevant text to your video content
 Put the main keywords in the first few paragraphs
 Keywords must be searchable
 Include hashtags
 Include timestamps
 Include links to related content if possible
 Provide affiliate links if you have any
Video descriptions must be concise yet comprehensive. You can create a conclusion for your video content. In addition, you should encourage viewers to read your description box to find more information.

4. Include Relevant Keywords for Tags

Tags are significant ranking factors for YouTube’s algorithm. Tags can be in the form of single words or phrases that give context to your video. The tags you use must also be keywordfriendly and relevant.
As a piece of metadata, tags have a significant role in defining your video ranking on YouTube’s search engine. Videos with matching tags and keywords will most likely appear on the first result page.

However, generating and choosing tags can be trickier than you think. Some tips below can help you make optimized tags to boost your video performance.
 Make the first tag filled with the main keywords
 Use broad and specific tags using short and longtailed keywords
 Don’t go overboard; stick to 58 keyword tags
 Keep your short tags to 23 words in length
 Find potential tags with online tools such as TugTube and vidIQ

5. Add Hashtags

YouTube reveals that hashtags (the ” symbol) can boost a video’s discoverability on the platform. You can find or put hashtags above the video’s title and inside the description box.
Video hashtags can optimize your SEO game and make your video more powerful in search engines. Hashtags help you garner viewers in three ways:
 Making it more discoverable

Making it more discoverable

For example, when you put ‘YouTube marketing’ as your hashtag, viewers can find your video through the search bar.
Competitors may also use the same hashtag as you. When their viewers click the hashtag, your content may also pop up as another resource.
 Helping YouTube understand your video better

Helping YouTube understand your video better

Just like tags, hashtags are essential for your video performance. They help YouTube algorithms crawl, index, and understand your video content faster and better. If you optimize your hashtags, you can get a higher chance of winning higher ranks.
 Tieing similar video content

Tieing similar video content

Hashtags can also tie similar content to your channel and automatically create a playlist. For example, you add QnAsessions as a hashtag for some of your videos with the QnA concept.
Users can find your QnA content easier through YouTube’s search engine as similar videos will line up automatically.
Using hashtags strategically can not only enhance discoverability but also support your broader goal of increasing your YouTube subscriber count by attracting targeted viewers who are more likely to engage with your content.
The best practice to generate powerful hashtags is similar to creating tags. You can put short and longtailed keywords and add your brand name or YouTube channel.

6. Add Subtitles or Closed Captions

Adding subtitles or closed captions on your YouTube videos can boost search rank, engagement, search traffic, and page views. The two are the text version of the audio in the video, but they do have differences.
In terms of intentions, subtitles aim to help viewers who don’t speak the language understand the video. Meanwhile, closed captions intend to help viewers with limited capabilities to hear audio.
However, in terms of forms, subtitles are typically optional for viewers to use or not. So, they have the option to turn on or off the subtitles. On the other hand, you can’t remove closed captions as they are attached to the video.
Many reports state that many users view videos without sound due to certain conditions. A whopping 92% of people watch videos in mute mode through mobile devices. So, you have a solid reason to add closed captions or subtitles to your videos.

7. Make Video Categorization

YouTube also allows you to categorize your video content. You can make all your content belong in the same category by setting a default category for your channel. It also lets you set individual categories for certain videos.
At least there are fifteen categories on YouTube, which are:
 Autos and vehicles
 Comedy
 Education
 Entertainment
 Film and animation
 Gaming
 Howto and style
 Music
 News and politics
 Nonprofits and activism
 People and blogs
 Pets and animals
 Sports
 Travel and events
 Science and technology
To set a default category for your channel, you can manage it through YouTube Studio. You can head to Settings > Upload Defaults > Advanced Settings and choose a default category for your channel. You can also set a default description and visibility for all your videos.
However, you can go to the ‘Content’ option below the Dashboard to set an individual video category. Then click on the video thumbnail and find the ‘Show More’ option on the bottom part of the interface.
Scroll down and find the ‘Category’ option. You can change your video category by choosing the option manually. YouTube categorization is essential to label your content and make it more visible through organic search.

8. Use Cards and End Screens

YouTube cards and end screens can be a great way to promote your videos. Do you notice the ‘i’ symbol in the righthand corner of a YouTube video? That is the place where you can put YouTube cards. You can set your other videos related to the one currently playing.
Meanwhile, end screens refer to the videos you want to promote at the end of your currentlyplaying video. Commonly YouTubers put two endscreen videos to encourage viewers to hop on another video and a subscribe button to garner followers.
Consider adding more elements to game up your end screens. Consider adding labels to your endscreen videos, such as ‘Watch Next,’ Play This Next,’ ‘Next Video,’ and so on. You can also add social icons like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.

9. Create YouTube Playlist

With plenty of videos on your channel, it can be messy and hard to follow viewers, especially new audiences. You can optimize your channel by creating playlists. Playlists will help viewers easily explore your channel and engage them longer.
Viewers can watch one video and continue to other related videos that belong in the same playlists. You can increase view counts, engagement rates, and, by extension, your rankings. In addition, playlists help YouTube to identify your video better.
For example, you can gather videos with similar concepts. You can create ‘Makeup Tutorials,’ ‘Makeup Reviews,’ ‘Daily Vlogs,’ and others.

10. Pin a Comment

You may have seen YouTubers pin some comments on their comment sections. Most likely, the pinned comments gain massive replies from other users. It’s a strategy that you can use to escalate your video’s rankability.
Not only does it boost your YouTube SEO, but pinned comments are also a great way to engage audiences. If you want to build deeper relationships with audiences, consider replying to some of their comments to show appreciation.
You can pin your own comment or others. Ensure that the comments you pin contain additional information relevant to your video content. You can encourage viewers to visit your social accounts or website by providing a link.

11. Create Enticing Thumbnail

Thumbnails are vital. Together with video titles, thumbnails are the first agents that attract audiences for the first time. Their roles are crucial in shaping audiences’ decisions to click your video or scroll it away.
Enticing thumbnails consist of visuals and short phrases or sentences to pull in viewers. You can use your picture or other objects that represent your content. Consider using editing tools like Canva and its alternatives, Photoshop and Picsart to edit photos for thumbnails.
Make sure you have verified your channel to make custom thumbnails. YouTube needs to verify your account by sending a verification code to your phone. You can verify your YouTube channel by visiting youtube.com/verify.
Most importantly, consider some parameters below to make optimized thumbnails for YouTube videos.
 Make your video thumbnails in a 16:9 ratio
 The most recommended resolution for YouTube thumbnails is 1280×720
 Keep thumbnails size up to 2MB
 Save your thumbnails as .jpg, .gif, .png, and .bmp files.
 Include persons in your thumbnails
 Add enticing words, phrases, or short sentences
The above points are your goto list to max up your YouTube SEO. It seems like a lot, but all your efforts in optimizing each point stated above will always be worth the results. To help you more, keep scrolling to reveal a list of tools to help you optimize YouTube SEO.
