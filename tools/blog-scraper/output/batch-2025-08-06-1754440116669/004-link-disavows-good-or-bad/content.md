With new google algorithms being rolled out constantly, many people wonder whether link disavows are good or bad for their sites when it comes to their rankings in the search engines.
We all know that a bad backlink can harm a website, but is a link disavow the answer? In this post, we’ll discuss exactly what a link disavow is, and how choosing to disavow links could be the only way to save your website from itself.

## What Is A Disavow List?

A disavow list is a list of backlinks to your site that are deemed dangerous, spammy and not worth keeping as part of your link profile.
These lists are often generated using a professional disavow tool, and that your disavow file is then submitted to Google Search Console through Google’s disavow tool in order to be removed from your link profile.
These disavow lists often content unnatural links from spam sites, spammy backlinks pointing to your site that are auto-generated, and any other type of potentially toxic backlinks.

## Are Link Disavows Good or Bad?

Link disavows are seen as being a great way to disavow backlinks and clean up your profile, and remove all potentially dangerous or spammy links from spammy pages that may have had you in a penalty in the past.
These services are known to have many benefits if carried out properly, from ensuring your backlinks are safe, eliminating and removing risky links from your profile, helping to lift you out of Google penalties from recent algorithm updates and potentially improving rankings.
So in general, link disavows are definitely a great service to have done, so long as your disavow is carried out by an experienced professional.

## How often should you disavow links?

As a general rule of thumb, it’s advised you look at removing your spam links every year or so to ensure any bad links are removed entirely.
Ignoring spammy links pointing to your site over an extended period of time can lead to an increased chance of landing in a Google penalty, and more times than not, people are surprised at just how many questionable links pointing back to your site you end up with from past link building campaigns.
Most sites nowadays will have bad backlinks that the owners simply aren’t aware of, which could be identified and dealt with by a professional backlink audit company.

## Examples of links that should be disavowed

There are many examples of links that should be disavowed from any link profile, including:

### Private Blogging Networks (PBNs)

Private Blog Network links, or PBNs for short, can be amongst the more spammy links in your profile, and if identified by Google, can be a big factor as to why you’re not raking online for your chosen keywords.
Unnatural links such as these can sometimes be picked up by Google employees themselves, landing you in a penalty can effect you site wide.
That’s why it’s important to act on any bad links as soon as you can, as sometimes you may not even know that a PBN link is pointing back to you until it pops up in a disavow tool.

### Low-quality directories

These low quality links can appear harmless, but a good disavow tool such a link research tools will quickly identify which of these directories are simply bad backlinks, and help you to move them into your disavow file.
Most sites will have some directories pointing to them in some capacity as part of a natural link building campaign, however, some of these can be extremely low quality links, and possibly worth removing.
When used properly, a good disavow tool will be able to locate any bad backlinks, including low quality directories, and help determine which need to be added to the disavow file.

### Comment and forum spam

These spammy links often clog up a link profile contribute to the number of unnatural links pointing back to your site.
Disavowing links such as these is a great way to quickly clean up your entire link profile, as adding low quality links to a disavow file and removing them through google’s disavow tool will help.
Again, a disavow tool will help identify these better than any, and provide you with the option of removing them.

### Negative SEO

Negative SEO attacks are a serious problem for many site owners, particularly in more difficult industries.
This manipulative link building technique is essentially carried out by a competitor that purposefully builds bad links to your site in order to negatively effect your rankings.
But don’t worry, these spammy links, often from spam sites in general, can be identified through a good disavow tool, and then removed through google’s disavow tool.
You’d be surprised how many of these links can end up as part of your disavow file..

### Paid Links

Paid links are backlinks that have been paid for by the website owner. Now with paid links, it’s not necessarily the case that all paid links are bad links, however often times, within your paid links there are some that are worth submitting to Google’s disavow tool in google search console.
This link building technique often returns a bit of a mixed bag of quality, so they’re certainly worth looking at.
Any unnatural links, spam links or low quality links often raise a bit of a red flag. A link disavow specialist will be able to use a disavow tool to identify which are worth adding to the disavow file, and removing through Google’s disavow tool.

### Hacked sites

Hacked sites are never good for any backlink profile, and often fall into the category of link spam with irrelevant anchor texts and high toxicity scores.
Link schemes like these can often fall under the same umbrella as negative SEO, but sometimes, site owners will buy links pointing to their site, without knowing they’re hacked.
These unnatural links are yet another example of why individuals look to disavow backlinks, as this link building method can seriously pull your entire site down as part of the updates in google’s algorithms.
