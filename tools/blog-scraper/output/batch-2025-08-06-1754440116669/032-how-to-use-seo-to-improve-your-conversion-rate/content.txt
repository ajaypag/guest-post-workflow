A high conversion rate is crucial for business success in today’s competitive digital market. It determines how effectively you turn website visitors into valuable customers, subscribers, or leads. If you’re struggling to improve your conversion rate, SEO conversion rate optimization can make a real difference.
SEO is known for increasing website visibility and attracting more visitors. But combining its strategies with CRO will also influence the chances of visitors becoming paying customers. Ultimately, it will increase your conversion rate.
Read on to learn what SEO conversion rate is, how it works, its benefits, and best practices. Implement these right, and it will increase your business growth and profitability. Before we jump into the details, let’s first understand the relationship between SEO and conversion rate.

Understanding The Relationship Between SEO & Conversion Rate

SEO and conversion rate have a symbiotic relationship. Simply put, without SEO (search engine optimization), there will be no traffic to convert. Similarly, without CRO (conversion rate optimization), the traffic you already have won’t convert into customers.
Effective SEO strategies optimize your website and content by adding relevant details like keywords and meta tags. As a result, it will rank your website higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) and bring in more organic traffic. In the competitive field of clinical genomics, this helps ensure your website attracts targeted visitors looking for specialized healthcare information and services.
Driving traffic alone does not guarantee success. That’s why CRO must come into play when your potential customers are on your site. It helps you create a userfriendly experience and persuade them to take the desired action. To further enhance these efforts, partnering with a white label SEO company can provide expertise in optimizing both traffic and conversions, ensuring a comprehensive approach to your digital marketing strategy.
Understanding the relationship between SEO and conversion rate is essential for achieving online success. But remember to analyze the problem first. Looking at the problem closely lets you know the exact strategy you can deploy, saving you time and resources. You may use the help of a digital marketing agency to implement a strategy that fits your business and goals. Partnering with a SaaS SEO agency can provide specialized expertise in optimizing softwareasaservice platforms for search engines.
Do a business assessment to define the challenges your company is facing. It should include the company’s performance, market trends, customer behavior, and competitors. By incorporating revenue data analysis into this assessment, you can gain deeper insights into how different factors impact your bottom line. Based on your data analysis, you can establish realistic and specific goals that align with your company’s objectives. Then, develop an action plan to address the identified problems and achieve your goals.
Now that you understand the relationship between SEO and conversion rate, it’s time to take action. We will unveil effective methods to improve your conversion rate using SEO. Read on and discover the strategies to drive tangible results and achieve your conversion goals.

7 Ways To Improve Your Conversion Rate Using SEO

Here are 7 actionable ways to improve your conversion rate using SEO tactics. We include practical examples and tools that can help you finetune your existing approach.

1. Understand Keywords

A keyword is a word or phrase people use to search for information relevant to a specific topic or industry. Since search engines prioritize websites that use relevant and popular keywords, you should collect the ones with high search volume.
Other than the search volume, here are the characteristics of keywords with high conversion potential. All keywords in the examples are relevant to an online retail shop.

1.1 Intent

These keywords demonstrate a specific need or desire, indicating a readiness to engage in a transaction. It often includes actionoriented words like buy, purchase, or order.
You can also create a sense of urgency by adding timerelated words such as today only, hurry, and don’t miss out. The screenshot below sets a good example.
It incorporates the words quick buy to trigger prospective customers to click immediately. It also provides urgencydriven offers (discounts) for its bestselling items.

1.2 LongTail Keywords

Shortform keywords can help you reach a broader audience. However, if you want to target a more specific and motivated audience, it’s best to use longtail keywords.
For instance, let’s say your online shop is promoting Halloween costumes. Shortform keywords like “Halloween costumes” attract many searchers, which includes those looking for costume ideas, history, or decorations. However, incorporating longtail keywords will narrow your target audience to those explicitly seeking Halloween costumes.
These keywords typically contain 3 or more words in length. They also have lower search volumes but higher relevance and conversion potential. Here are a few examples of longtail keywords for Halloween costumes:
 Buy Halloween costumes today
 Hurry, limited quantities of superhero costumes left
 Check out our spooky Halloween costume collection

2. Conduct Thorough Keyword Research

Keyword research is the process of finding the words and phrases people use to search for information online. It often starts by brainstorming a list of relevant keywords with your team. Keywords that you think people might use to search for your business or industry. It may include product names, industryspecific terms, and common phrases.
Once you complete the list, you can start the search using your chosen keyword research tool. It’s a software or online service designed to provide valuable insights into the following:
 Keyword difficulty
 Search volume data
 Competition analysis
 Longtail keyword suggestions
You can find lots of keyword research tools, but one that stands out is SEMrush. It has 5 keyword research features; the newest addition is Keyword Manager. You only need to choose a topic and add a few seed keywords. It will display a list and you can allow them to write content for each target keyword.
Google Keyword Planner is a reliable alternative option for anyone looking for a free tool. It also offers valuable data and analysis to help businesses make informed decisions about their keyword strategies and improve their SEO tactics. After establishing your baseline, save your list and align them with your SEO goal.

Best Practice: Refine & Update

Keyword research is an ongoing process. Make sure to regularly perform the following to stay relevant in today’s fastchanging market:
 Monitor trends
 Analyze keyword performance
 Tailor your keyword strategy to match user intent
 Use location wisely to find new keywords (or use targeting for your ads)

3. Consider UserGenerated Queries & Voice Search Trends

When developing your keyword strategy, always consider user questions in voice and text searches. The reason – both reflect the actual language and phrases people use when searching for information online.
Particularly for voice search because it uses a more natural and conversational language. You can see in the screenshot below what people expect to receive from brands.
Here are a few ideas for incorporating usergenerated queries and voice search trends into your keyword strategy. We’ll use the keyword GMP audit as an example.

3.1 Longtail keywords

Finding relevant longtail keywords is an important aspect of a comprehensive keyword strategy. But the search process can be challenging at times. Voice searches help because they often contain longer and more conversational queries.
Instead of targeting a generic keyword like GMP audit, you can consider longtail keywords like:
 Effective strategies for passing a GMP audit
 Best practices for preparing for a GMP audit
 Common GMP audit findings and how to address them
Effective strategies for passing a GMP audit
Best practices for preparing for a GMP audit

3.2 Question Phrases

Voice search users often ask detailed questions to get specific information and actionable insights. You can optimize your content to address specific questions relevant to your industry or niche.
GMP audits are vital for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. Passing the audit means they maintain highquality standards in their production processes. So, you can create each piece of content around these question phrases:
 What is the role of quality control in GMP audits?
 What are some effective strategies for passing a GMP audit?
 How do smallscale pharmaceutical manufacturers prepare for a GMP audit?

3.3 Knowledge Base & FAQ Pages

A knowledge base provides a wealth of valuable content, which you can optimize for relevant keywords. You can incorporate specific keywords and address common search queries to increase your knowledge base page rank in SERPs. Also, making information readily available will reduce friction in the customer journey.
Here are some quality topics you can include in your knowledge base articles to educate your current and firsttime visitors:
You can also add FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) pages to address common questions people ask. You can identify common questions that customers ask by reviewing your customer support tickets, emails, and messages.
 GMP guidelines
 GMP resources by country
 GMP regulations and preambles
You can also watch social media platforms, forums, and online communities relevant to your business. It can provide valuable insights into the concerns and inquiries of your target audience. For GMP audits, here are some questions you may include:
 What is a GMP certificate?
 How is a GMP inspection conducted?
 How will manufacturers be inspected?
 What are the levels of GMP compliance?
 What is good manufacturing practice (GMP)?

4. Optimize OnPage Elements

Poor conversion rates result from various factors and a lack of attention to onpage elements is one of them. You can use Google Analytics and customer insights to determine how users interact with your website and where they drop off in the conversion funnel.
Identify which onpage elements are hindering the user experience through these data. Adjust them accordingly, and it will improve the average conversion rate. Here are some onpage elements that you should consider optimizing:

4.1 Headlines & Page Titles

Craft attentiongrabbing headlines and page titles that convey your offer’s value proposition. Add relevant keywords to improve search engine visibility and attract organic visitors. With customizable poster templates, you can create eyecatching visuals that complement your content, making it more digestible and engaging for readers.

4.2 Content

Make sure your content is informative, engaging, and tailored to your target audience. Also, use clear and concise language. You can break up a wall of text with headings, subheadings, and some visuals.

4.3 Calls to Action (CTA)

Place clear and prominent CTAs throughout your website. It will guide users toward a specific conversion goal. Use persuasive language and design elements that make CTAs stand out.
Creating the anchor text is simple. Choose a word that accurately reflects the content it links to. Only aim for 2 to 5 words for your anchor text CTA. This length allows for a straightforward message that grabs the reader’s attention and encourages action.
If this isn’t your cup of tea, you can use an anchor text suggestion tool. Simply put your brand name, keywords, page type, and anchor text type to generate anchor text ideas.
Test multiple variations to determine the most effective placement, size, and color. The call to action button color needs to stand out. You can choose the color that matches your brand or pick one of these colors: red, green, yellow, and orange. Anything exciting is warm and ideal to use (see screenshot below).
To help you select the perfect color combination, consider using a color wheel to find complementary colors that enhance your button’s visibility.

5. Create Relevant & SEOOptimized Content

Crafting highquality content is another powerful method for increasing conversion rates. It builds trust, establishes credibility, and positions your brand as a reliable authority.
Focus on delivering value through informative and engaging content. It should also resonate with their needs and interests. You can provide this by writing content that aligns with each stage of the buyer’s journey.
Your content will serve as a guide so the consumers can make an informed decision or purchase. Let’s consider HVAC advertising and marketing strategies, for example. Here’s how they can create content to support the buyer’s journey:

A. Awareness Stage

Potential customers are researching general information about HVAC systems or common HVAC problems. The HVAC company can create blog posts, videos, or social media content that provide educational resources.
The ultimate guide to understanding HVAC systems or Top 10 energysaving Tips for your home are a few topics you can discuss. These pieces of content help establish the company’s expertise and build brand awareness.

B. Consideration Stage

Prospective customers are actively evaluating their options on which HVAC companies to get. The company can create comparison guides or case studies highlighting its unique selling propositions, such as advanced dosing system. This system helps ensure precision in product dispensing, adding value to the overall offering. Leveraging customer testimonials can further showcase the reliability and effectiveness of these dosing systems, reinforcing the company’s commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.

C. Decision Stage

Turning organic traffic into customers – your website visitor is ready to decide which HVAC company to get. The company can create content that focuses on its specific offers. Service packages, financing options, and warranty details to name a few.
Whether you’re writing blog posts or email newsletters, this content strategy will work wonders. This can even help you for writing social media updates.
Let’s consider a scenario where the HVAC company uses WhatsApp Business as a communication channel. They want to create a greeting message to support the buyer’s journey:
 Awareness stage: Write a WhatsApp Business greeting message introducing their services and highlighting key benefits
 Consideration stage: Include testimonials or customer reviews demonstrating exceptional service quality
 Decision stage: Provide a calltoaction message to encourage customers to take the next step
Remember to optimize them for search engines to increase organic website traffic. You can focus on the following aspects:
 Compelling headlines
 Natural keyword integration
 Incorporating visuals (images, videos, or infographics)

6. Focus on Customer Retention

Customer retention is also a big part of the customer journey. It allows business owners to maintain a positive relationship and encourage repeat business. Let’s consider a scenario where a cleaning company wants to offer online courses for new entrepreneurs.
First, they need to build a solid community. When individuals feel connected to a brand and its community, they are more likely to engage and become brand advocates. Once they do, they can offer online resources and courses to help new entrepreneurs start their own cleaning businesses.
They can also share a comprehensive guide to help new entrepreneurs pick an outstanding cleaning business name or set the right price for your cleaning services. Offering online courses will enhance customer retention. But the most crucial benefit it provides is positioning your business as an industry expert and thought leader. Additionally, integrate sales enablement into this approach to empower your team to effectively promote these courses, ensuring that potential customers understand the value and resources available to them. Make sure to leverage the data collected in your CSP software to optimize your sales pipeline and identify areas where you can improve your conversion rates.

7. Evaluate the Website’s Technical Performance

A welldesigned and intuitive user interface captures users’ attention. It encourages them to stay longer on your website. Making it visually appealing and easy to navigate with clear calls to action is one good way to deliver it. However, it’s not enough.
You still need to conduct a comprehensive SEO audit of your website to identify areas for improvement. We’ll dive deep into the website’s technical performance:

7.1 Page Speed

Page speed refers to how quickly a web page loads in a user’s browser. It is a critical factor that impacts both user experience and search engine optimization.
A good rule of thumb is to have a website that loads quickly in real time, around 12 seconds. It will have lower bounce rates and higher engagement. If you’re experiencing slow loading speed, you can optimize your website’s page speed by using the following techniques:
 Minifying code
 Compressing images
 Leveraging browser caching
 Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Search engines like Google consider page speed as a ranking factor. So, find the sweet spot between a fastloading website and maintaining quality content.

7.2 Mobile Responsiveness

A mobileresponsive website automatically adjusts its layout, design, and functionality to fit the screen of the user’s device. It ensures that users can easily navigate, read content, and interact with the website without the need for constant zooming or scrolling. It’s a timely change as mobile device usage continues to rise.
Creating a mobileresponsive website involves the following steps:
 Step 1: Pick a responsive design framework or template that automatically adjusts the layout and design based on the screen size
 Step 2: Use fluid grids and flexible images so they can adapt to different screen resolutions without losing quality. An image enhancer can improve the clarity and detail of visuals, ensuring they remain sharp even when resized across various devices. This tool helps maintain a polished, highquality appearance in responsive layouts.
 Step 3: Use collapsible menus, accordions, or tabs to arrange your content based on its importance and relevance
 Step 4: Ensure that buttons, links, and interactive elements are large enough to be easily tapped with a finger. Consider using a QR code to provide quick access to additional resources, as they allow users to scan and retrieve information instantly.
 Step 5: Regularly test your website on various mobile devices to identify any issues or inconsistencies
 Step 6: Consider integrating mobilespecific features that enhance the user experience (geolocation, camera access, etc.)
Make sure to stay uptodate with the latest mobile design trends and emerging technologies. These can help you enhance your mobile responsiveness over time.
7.3 Crawlability
Crawlability refers to the search engine crawler’s ability to navigate and access your website’s content for indexing and ranking purposes. It plays a crucial role in determining the visibility of your web pages in search results.
You can optimize your website’s crawlability to enhance organic search visibility further. Here are factors you need to consider to ensure effective crawlability:
 Regularly check for crawl errors, such as broken links or inaccessible pages
 Create a network of internal links that connect different pages within your website
 Implement and submit a sitemap to search engines, such as Google Search Console
 Optimize meta tags (title tags and meta descriptions) with relevant keywords
Conclusion
Leveraging SEO strategies to improve the conversion rate is a gamechanger for every business. It doesn’t just attract more organic traffic, it also optimizes various elements on your website. Optimizing these elements will increase their effectiveness in converting visitors into customers.
