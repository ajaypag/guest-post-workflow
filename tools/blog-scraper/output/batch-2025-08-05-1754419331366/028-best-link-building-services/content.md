## Best Link Building Services Criteria

A successful link building campaign means higher rankings, better traffic, more leads, and more deals. And an unsuccessful campaign can set your business back big time.
Whether you’re a strictly white hat or are open to the grey and black arts, you need a vendor that delivers quality links in a strategic fashion. That’s why we built this list, the Link Builders 50.
> We actually went out there and contacted each and every single vendor to get more information on what link building tactics do they use, what their pricings are, what additional services do they provide (blogger outreach), and what their SEO metrics are, namely their Domain Rating and organic traffic (as these are essential indicators of expertise).

We also took note of the rate at which they responded, and whether they were open to doing blogger outreach to a list of websites we provide (as an honesty check for any link building business claiming to do real blogger outreach).
When you’re not sure who brings you the right balance of cost, quality, and results, check out our list to get some help deciding.

## Top 10 Link Building Agencies for 2023


## 1. Outreach Labs


### Outreach Labs Review:

Outreach Labs has developed a unique Value-First Outreach framework to help clients score hard to get backlinks from corporate, niche and personal blogs.
In short, they look to enter your niche as a value provider – featured influencers and popular blogs in guest posts which open doors for their client link building campaigns.
This roundabout approach drives high quality links that a typical cold pitch can’t get.
It’s a novel and from their case studies, it looks extremely effective.
That, plus their fair monthly pricing and excellent communication makes Outreach Labs a fine choice for your next link building agency.

### Outreach Labs Response Speed:

We received a response within 24 hours and were able to schedule a free consult through their dashboard easily.

### Outreach Labs Link Building Tactics:

Their key differentiators are centered around what they don’t do. Guest post farms and semi-questionable websites are on their no-no list. A trend that has become concerning for many business owners recently is the growth of strong metric guest post farms that look good on paper but carry no long term benefit.
Outreach Labs’s Value-First Outreach framework does outreach in your niche to generate link insertion, guest posts and influencer swap opportunities on quality sites where its not even possible to pay for a link.

### Outreach Labs Pricing Policy:

Their packages start at $1499. You choose a monthly budget and they build a range of links within that package. Each link is assigned a monetary value based on the DR, traffic and type of links it is. For example, if they score mostly high end links a particular month, the total links delivered will be less than if they’d scored mostly medium-authority links.

### Does Outreach Labs Do Real Blogger Outreach?

They absolutely do! They target links from blogs with a content manager, content marketers, traffic-having niche sites, or in general, picky blogs.

Linkdoctor Review:
LinkDoctor is one of the few link-building agencies that value the importance of white hat link building.
They offer three main services: Blogger Outreach Services, Guest Post Service, and White Label SEO Reselling.
Their high-quality services don’t just stop at delivering the links to you. Being a customer-centric company, they go the extra mile to conduct SEO audits and studies how your website and company can succeed even more.
It’s evident that they deliver what they promise based on the positive reviews they receive from their clients.
You can also check their site and view their case studies. The one that caught our attention was their success in increasing the ranking of Topspeed.com, one of their previous clients, for a highly competitive keyword “Car games”. You can view the detailed case study here.
LinkDoctor Link Building Tactics:
LinkDoctor’s strategy mainly involves the creation of high-quality guest posts. Their teams meticulously research and brainstorm before conducting outreach campaigns to make sure that clients benefit from each backlink acquired for them.

Does Linkdoctor Do Real Blogger Outreach?
They’re very transparent with their services. They give a disclaimer when clients demand some difficult tasks to achieve like reaching out to highly authoritative sites that it would take time. They do not reach out to a created list of websites but creates campaigns carefully depending on the niche of their clients.
Linkdoctor Response Speed:
LinkDoctor responds instantly, not going over 24 hours. But they may have some delayed responses on weekends which is understandable.
Linkdoctor’s Own SEO:
The website has a DR of 44 and traffic of less than 100. But this is probably because they rebranded their company from Organic Link Builders to LinkDoctor, a fairly new website compared to their competitors

### LinkPitch.io’s Own SEO:

#### Does Link Fish Media Do Real Blogger Outreach?

Link Fish Media don’t reach out to the same sites that link to your competitors as they have “no desire to recreate someone else’s link profile since no two sites are the same” and scan for link building opportunities themselves.

#### Link Fish Media Response Speed:

We got no response after we’ve submitted the contact form (twice), so we were unable to see if Link Fish Media would do custom outreach too.

#### Link Fish Media’s Own SEO:

Only some of their pages are allowed for crawling, so the data we got from Ahrefs is inaccurate.

### 14. SearchRPM

SearchRPM is a digital marketing company in Austin TX that’s at the epicenter of the online ecosystem.

#### Smash Digital Review:

Smash Digital have created quite a reputation for themselves by thinking outside of the box when it comes to SEO. They generally don’t accept the status quo without supporting evidence. In fact, they believe that half of popular accepted SEO knowledge is wrong, full of propaganda, and actually hurts webmasters.
Smash Digital tests, reinvents and creates systems to drive targeted visitors to your site for the long-haul.
Put simply, Smash Digital is all about doing what works.
(and not taking themselves too seriously)
They can back up everything they say. Founder Travis Jamison owns a portfolio of successful businesses, all of which use SEO as their main traffic source. They know what it takes to get results and offer the same systems for their clients.

#### Smash Digital Link Building Tactics:

The manager told us that building links with our own prospects might not be the most efficient way of doing it, but agreed to do it, so you can be sure about their transparency.

#### Smash Digital’s Own SEO:

Their website could use some work, with only 37 DR and 74 organic visitors monthly.

### 17. LinkGraph


#### LinkGraph Review:

LinkGraph has the highest-powered links in the business, where most SEO companies cap out at DA 40, they specialize in DA 50-90+.
Every high-quality link they place is pitched to publishers organically in an original piece of content (article, blog post, press release, etc). Their unique high-quality content is drafted specifically to provide contextual relevance to the anchor text linking to your website, and written to fit the audience and stylistic guidelines of the publications they’re targeting. LinkGraph run their link building tactics and publisher outreach at scale, allowing them to consistently acquire high-quality links.

#### LinkGraph Link Building Tactics:

While many SEO companies will focus on guest blogging, they’ve worked hard to build countless direct relationships with marquee publishers so that the majority of their content placements appear fully organic (without sponsored tags or guest post attribution). Their editorial link building strategy allows them to attract links that send the most topically relevant link juice from these publishers to your domain, pushing you higher in the rankings and increasing traffic to your site.

#### LinkGraph Pricing Policy:

The prices for their monthly plans start at $549/month, with the most advanced one capping out at $999/month.
The number of links built depends on the DA of the target website. If you break the highest-priced plan down, you will get 10 DA 30-40 links, 6 DA 40-50 links, 4 DA 50-70 links, or 3 DA 70-100 links.

#### How to Order from LinkGraph :

You can order one of their plans right from the website, or schedule a free consultation to discuss a more personalized approach to your campaign.

#### Does LinkGraph Do Real Blogger Outreach?:

The LinkGraph team will secure your placements on relevant publications and has an impressive portfolio of direct relationships with well-known, quality publishers.

#### LinkGraph Response Speed:

We tried reaching LinkGraph through the contact email, but never got a response. We haven’t tried to book a consultation though, so if you try that approach you’re much more likely to get a swift, professional reply.
LinkGraph is one of the most respected and highly voted vendors on this list, so our situation is rather an exception than the rule.

#### LinkGraph’s Own SEO:

Ahrefs displays their DR as 41 with 15,400 organic visits each month, but a lot of their pages are blocked from crawling so this data is not particularly accurate.

### 18. LinkLifting


#### LinkLifting Review:

LinkLifting isn’t your typical SEO software. In fact, it isn’t software at all. Instead, LinkLifting is a fully managed service carried out by a team of experienced SEO professionals, all of whom have extensive experience working with small businesses and big brands alike.

#### How to Order from LinkLifting:

All you need to do is enter your website in the form at the top. LinkLifting’s system will automatically suggest the keywords and most relevant pages of your website for promotion, as well as recommending a monthly budget to achieve your results. Or you could choose up to 10 keywords manually.

#### LinkLifting Response Speed:

Our reply hit our inbox the following morning.

#### LinkLifting Link Building Tactics:

To secure backlinks, the LinkLifting team employs strategies involving blog articles, profile links, article comments, and social media mentions. Those might not be the strongest links ever, but their price is also a whole order of magnitude lower than most other vendors on this list.
In addition to link building, the cost also includes SEO services to improve your site’s online visibility.

#### Does LinkLifting Do Real Blogger Outreach?

Disappointingly, the team refused to reach out to our prospect list.

#### LinkLifting Pricing Policy:

As described by a member of the LinkLifting team, a typical monthly budget is anywhere between $100 and $500, which is rather cheap. If you’d like a more inclusive campaign, you can also place a custom order, and the bigger your budget, the more backlinks will be built for you, naturally.
They also feature a very handy quote form which enables you to estimate the cost of your campaign right on their page.

#### LinkLifting ’s Own SEO:

Speaking of pages, most of theirs are blocked from crawling, so we were unable to get their DR and organic traffic for you. Sorry!

### 19. Linkshero


#### Linkshero Review:

The amount (and quality) of backlinks pointing to your site is a top factor for your website’s success. The problem is – white hat link building is always an ungrateful and daunting process because the conversion rates are so low.
Yes, there is A LOT of rejection.
In fact, for every 100 leads, you’d get approximately 3 links. The rest is a “no” and that hurts…
And this is when Linkshero comes in. Their experienced team, armed with the market’s best tools and a very large amount of “notgivingashit”, cuts right through it. Linkshero get the links you deserve.
But that’s not all.
If you work with them you also get:
• Free help with creating top-class linkable assets that attract links like a magnet;
• Custom insights on how you can solidify your E-A-T (i.e. Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
• Your SEO-related questions answered by Artem, the founder of Linkshero;
• And more.

#### Linkshero Link Building Tactics:

Linkshero focuses solely on white-hat link building techniques, completely rejecting comment link building, web 2.0 links, PBNs, directories, along with anything else that could damage your brand in the future.

#### How to Order from Linkshero:

To order from Linkshero, you will first need to schedule a call with its founder or reach them on LinkedIn.

#### Linkshero Response Speed:

They never added us on LinkedIn and scheduling a consultation without a real project to discuss is somewhat preposterous, so we’re not sure how much a link building campaign by Linkshero would cost you, but the owner is one of the better-known SEOs out there, and their service has tons of extremely positive reviews, so you can be confident Linkshero will deliver quality links for you.

#### Linkshero ’s Own SEO:

The Linkshero website is simply the owner’s little presentation of themselves and what they do and only features a handful of pages, with only 13 DR and 29 monthly organic traffic.

### 20. Breeeze


#### Breeeze Review:

Breeeze presents itself as a performance-driven B2B SEO and link-building agency that helps businesses get to the top. That could be the top of search results, business success – or both.
Breeeze offers several unique selling points:
• Users pay for what they get, although their average is DR60+.
• Breeeze builds sustainable SEO strategies focused on growth opportunities to grow organic traffic and MRR
• There’s a flat fee per link.
• Their links are do-follow.
Breeeze has been hired by inBeat, its sibling company. If you didn’t know this, inBeat is an influencer marketing platform that used to have just 500 visitors per month. Breeeze increased that number to 70,000 visitors per month, adding $4,000,000 in pipeline value.

#### Breeeze Response Speed:

You can contact Breeeze easily, setting a virtual meeting on Calendly at your earliest convenience. You can find free spots during the same day, and you’ll connect directly with David Morneau, CEO and SEO strategist of this company.

#### How to Order from Breeeze:

You can order directly from their Pricing page. Here’s the best part:
Once you hit that “get started” button, you’re automatically directed to their meeting scheduling page. That means you’re not just blindingly buying a generic package or solution. You can pick a 100% customized solution after a free strategy talk with Breeeze’s CEO.

#### Breeeze Link Building Tactics:

Breeeze’s link-building tactics are centered on two pillars: Google’s guidelines and sustainable SEO.
That’s why they can promise long-term results.
But Breeeze adapts its tactics according to each customer. For example, they can use HARO, relationship-based link-building, identifying low-hanging fruit keywords, and more. For their inBeat sibling, they also focused on building multiple free tools with high-traffic potential.

#### Breeeze Pricing Policy:

Breeeze’s pricing policy is straightforward: $400 flat-fee link pricing. However, they clearly state you “pay for what you get.” So, you’ll have to book that meeting with David Morneau to find out exactly what you can expect to get.

#### Does Breeeze Do Real Blogger Outreach?

Yes, they do. You can arrange all these details during the virtual meet-up.

#### Breeeze’s Own SEO:

Ahrefs lists Breeeze with a DR24, but you know what they say about the Shoemaker’s shoes. It’s much more important that Breeeze brought its customers to a range of DR50 to DR90+.

### 21. Loganix


#### Loganix Review:

Their link building philosophy revolves around analyzing link opportunities using a variety of metrics beyond the standard authority metrics from Moz, Ahrefs, and Majestic. The end result of any Loganix campaign is natural link placements within the content, from sites that have a real audience and search traffic.
Spammy directory links and poorly built PBNs are out of date and ineffective if you’re investing in links for your site you want to make sure they pack a punch and stick around.

#### Loganix Link Building Tactics:

Through relationships they’ve built with publishers and authors/contributors, they’ve been able to place 10s of thousands of quality links for their customers that would’ve been nearly impossible to get through traditional link building and outreach methods.

#### Loganix Response Speed:

Our questions got answered the next day.

#### How to Order from Loganix:

Loganix features a dashboard called DIY links where you can manually pick your placements, add them to your card and purchase them right then and there. The cost of content is included in the price.

#### Does Loganix Do Real Blogger Outreach?

They agreed to reach out to a custom list of prospects, but only if their contributors have them in their inventory, which is a bit disappointing.

#### Loganix Pricing Policy:

There are three types of services Loganix provides. The first being none other than guest posting with prices ranging from $200 to $300 per link.
They call their second service Authority Links Placements, but it is essentially the same thing, with a higher Domain Authority. A link like that would cost you anywhere from $400 to $600.
Their final service is access to their database of inclusion opportunities. For only $9.99/month you can see each site Loganix has previously worked with that is up for receiving guest posts.
However, publishing on those resources isn’t free (of course) and you will have to pay anywhere from a couple hundred up to thousands of dollars depending on the URL chosen.

#### Loganix ’s Own SEO:

With a DR of 70 and organic traffic that is over 3,200 unique visits monthly, you can be sure they know what they’re doing.

### 22. One Way Links

#### Upper Ranks Response Speed:

We messaged the email address right above the contact form (as always, twice) and got no answer. So, without any information regarding their prices, we can only estimate how much The Upper Ranks’ services cost and guess whether they are up for custom outreach.

#### Upper Ranks’s Own SEO:

The Upper Ranks website is protected by a firewall hiding their data, but we do know that their DR is at least 54.

#### Submit Core’s Own SEO:

The Submit Core website can only be crawled partly, so getting accurate data regarding their DR and organic traffic is outside of our reach.

### 27. Desire Marketing

Desire Marketing Review:
Desire Marketing is an affordable link building company that offers customized and targeted services.
With over 5 years of experience, they’ve created a large catalog of 9K blogs in almost every niche to gain links from. Whenever their clients need links from blogs that aren’t in their database, they do outreach based on those requirements.
Their primary goal is to develop a brand-specific strategy to build contextually relevant links for each website. Such links send signals of authority to Google, Bing, and other search engines to rank them higher.
Desire Marketing Link Building Tactics:
Desire Marketing specialists use three ways to build links – guest posting, blogger outreach, and niche edits.
To do guest posting, they interact with influential bloggers and contribute high-quality content with clients’ links to their blogs. Or they can order blog owners to write an article themselves. That way, the link will appear on behalf of the site admin rather than a guest writer.
The tactic of niche edits is less time-consuming, as there’s no need to write an entire article for the sake of a single backlink. Instead, outreach specialists ask bloggers to insert their client’s link into an already published post.
How to Order from Desire Marketing:
To order Desire Marketing services, you can contact their team by email (support@desire.marketing) or mobile / WhatsApp.
Desire Marketing Pricing Policy:
Desire Marketing doesn’t have a one-for-all price. Since every case is unique, they customize their pricing packages to the budget and individual needs of each client. They do an SEO audit of their client’s website and provide a detailed estimate of how many links they’ll need and how much that will cost.
Note that if you are an agency, they’ll also let you resell links to your clients.
Desire Marketing Response Speed:
We reached out to their team on Friday morning and received a reply on the same day in a few hours.
Does Desire Marketing Do Real Blogger Outreach?
Yes, their team members don’t use any black-hat tactics like automated link building. They reach out to each blogger individually by email to get them to insert their clients’ links manually.
Desire Marketing Own SEO:
According to Ahrefs estimates, the domain rating (DR) of Desire Marketing is 52 at the moment.

### 30. The Hoth


#### The Hoth Review:

The HOTH is an acronym for Hittem Over The Head, in other words, to bludgeon with awesomeness. It can be used as a noun (as in their product, or their brand) or as a verb (i.e. To HOTH someone, to HOTH something).
When the HOTH was started in 2010, the industry was plagued by sketchy service providers with poor support. The HOTH was to change all that. They became the best SEO company so you would have an amazing experience.
The HOTH put their names and faces on it, made support a priority, and gave out guarantees, developing an entire suite of products to fit your needs. They made a streamlined production system that allows the team to deliver their custom projects and campaigns with agility, speed, and scale. All in a nicely wrapped interface that produces results for you, day in, and day out.

#### How to Order from The Hoth:

You can schedule a free consultation and discuss your order with one of their account managers through an interactive calendar.

#### The Hoth Link Building Tactics:

The team employs lots of different strategies depending on the type of service you’ve selected.

#### The Hoth Pricing Policy:

The HOTH offers a variety of services from generating leads to improving your site’s SEO and, of course, link building.
As for link building services, there is quite a selection as well: HOTH GuestPost, HOTH GuestPost PRO, HOTH Foundations, HOTH Blitz, and HOTH Boost. Let’s look at them one by one.
The HOTH GuestPost package has a name that speaks for itself. It is your standard guest posting offer with pricings depending on the DA of the site linking to you, starting at $100/link from a DA 10+ resource up to $500/link for a 50+ DA site.
The difference between the regular and the PRO version of the HOTH GuestPost lies in how the prospects are chosen. In the PRO package, instead of looking at a site’s DA, the team looks at how much monthly organic traffic a resource is getting.
A link from a site with a thousand organic visitors will cost you $200, and if you’d like to go for bigger resources with up to 25,000 organic traffic the price will go up to $500. Sure, this service is a little bit more expensive, but organic traffic is also a more accurate representation of a site’s well-being than its Domain Authority.
Next up is the HOTH Foundations. To sum up how it works: firstly, the team sets up mini-authority properties on blogging platforms, where contextual links back to your site are placed in original, semantically relevant content. Of course, you have complete control over your anchor text.
The prices for this package range anywhere from $60 to $500 depending on the number of URLs, blogs, and whether you’re looking for regular or premium content.
You will find the HOTH Blitz offer interesting if you’re looking to quickly boost your secondary resource. The team has a lot of connections with websites from practically every niche out there. And this offer secures permanent backlinks in the homepage sidebars of those sites.
You can get 5 such links for as little as $250, 10 for $450, and 20 for $875.
Last but not least is the HOTH Boost. This offer gets you in-content links on high-DA resources to, once again, boost your secondary properties, social media posts, videos, etc.
It is also the cheapest, with two pricing choices: $49 and $149 for 50 and 250 posts respectively.
The HOTH offers a pretty impressive range of services which you will surely find helpful.

#### The Hoth Response Speed:

The initial response to our email directed us to their 27-page price list, which, while being very clear and informative can feel a little intimidating at first and it would be nice if someone explained how all those work in person.
They did offer to schedule a free consultation with one of their managers though, so they are redeemed. That reply came in the following morning by the way, which is not bad at all.

#### Does The Hoth Do Real Blogger Outreach?

The HOTH has an already impressive database of publishers who accept guest posts, but their number grows daily and they are open for custom outreach, so there’s zero doubt about the validity of their services.

#### The Hoth ’s Own SEO:

The HOTH website is huge with a DR of 72 and 86,400 monthly organic visitors, and they are very professional about how they approach every single task thrown at them.

Their website can’t be crawled at all so no data on their metrics here.

### 33. Stuart C McHenry


#### Stuart C McHenry Review:

It used to be that search engines would reward content with top rankings so long as they had links to support them. In the past few years, search engines have changed their algorithms.
Links must be relevant to your content, or your page might lose its ranking. Even worse, your website could get penalized in the search engines.
Stuart doesn’t use any unproven tactics or jump on the current bandwagon of link building strategies. Those shortcuts never last long and will only ruin your ROI.
“My outreach and link building process will provide quality links that will maintain rankings for years to come.”, as stated by Stuart himself.

#### Stuart C McHenry Link Building Tactics:

The majority of the backlinks they build for their clients are done via guest posting, unlinked mentions, interviews, and content-driven tactics. These are the type of links you will be proud to show off.

#### How to Order from Stuart C McHenry:

To place an order you will have to discuss it with the owner through their email you can find, intuitively, on the Contact page.

#### Stuart C McHenry Pricing Policy:

The average price is $300/link, but it can fluctuate depending on your niche. More competitive niches cost more to build links in.

#### Does Stuart C McHenry Do Real Blogger Outreach?

Stuart agreed to reach out to 500 of our prospects, but for a different price. They charged us an hourly fee of $150.

#### Stuart C McHenry Response Speed:

Stuart works alone, so their response rate might not be as swift as other vendors, but we got our reply the next day.

#### Stuart C McHenry’s Own SEO:

Their website’s DR is 40 with only 52 organic visitors per month.

#### Internet Marketing Ninjas Response Speed:

The reply to our initial email came in as little as 10 minutes.

#### Does Internet Marketing Ninjas Do Real Blogger Outreach?:

They are one of the very few vendors who actually refused to do outreach to our prospect list because they “have their unique process and are unable to process someone else’s link building plan”.

#### Internet Marketing Ninjas’s Own SEO:

But they clearly know what they are doing with a high Domain Rating of 78 and with 26,600 unique organic visits to boot.

### Sunrise


#### Sunrise Review:

Sunrise will help you by providing quality content for building links naturally. As they provide the most affordable rates for their link building services, they are the best choice for every budget company.
Search engine optimizations fail if you opt for link building services from companies that don’t provide you with quality content and relevant placements. Building quality backlinks has become much harder due to Google’s algorithm becoming smarter, because of the increased availability of the Internet all over the world.
Sunrise is the most trusted link building company in India today as they make sure to follow Google’s guidelines while providing you with high-quality links.

#### How to Order from Sunrise:

Ordering is done through email.

#### Sunrise Link Building Tactics:

SunTec employs content marketing, guest posting, forums, Q&As, broken link building, infographics, and other strategies depending on your website.
They also have a directory of “free sites” (their description, not ours), from which you can get links for an extremely low price.

#### Sunrise Pricing Policy:

Directory submissions will only cost you $15/link. As for proper placements on relevant resources, it can go all the way up to $200/link.

#### Does Sunrise Do Real Blogger Outreach?

At first, the fact that they sell links for only $15 (they even offered us a discount to do it for $10) tipped us off a little bit. But when we asked about doing custom outreach, they actually accepted our list, showing us that the directory is just one of the routes they can take.

#### Sunrise Response Speed:

It took them 3 days to process our questions. A little bit faster would be better.

#### Sunrise Response Speed:

No accurate data here, thanks to the firewall protecting it.

#### JDM Web Technologies Pricing Policy:

There is a total of 4 packages you can buy, ranging from $495/month to $1295/month.
The only difference between JDM Web Technologies’ packages is the amount of work done and there is no such thing as a premium service you have to pay extra for.

#### JDM Web Technologies Link Building Tactics:

Their services are quite varied and they acquire links through guest posting, microblogging, social bookmarking, and everything in between.

#### Does JDM Web Technologies Do Real Blogger Outreach?

They too agreed to do outreach to our own prospects, but couldn’t guarantee they would get all of them to link back, which is more than reasonable seeing that their count is measured in three-digit numbers.

#### JDM Web Technologies’s Own SEO:

We couldn’t get an accurate representation of their website’s DR and organic traffic since a lot of the pages are blocked from crawling.

#### SunTec Review:

SunTec is more of an SEO agency, but offer link building services as well. The process involves the identification of suitable web pages, forums, and discussion groups, sending link requests, and validation of backlinks after they are developed.

#### How to Order from SunTec:

To place your order, you will have to use a contact form or reach the team through their email to discuss your project before purchasing.

#### SunTec Response Speed:

We found our reply in our inbox the next day.

#### SunTec Pricing Policy:

The assistant manager in touch gave us three prices. $900/month, $2400/month, and $4500/month. He elaborated on them, explaining the workflow and how a dedicated team member would work 8 hours each business day solely on our project.
He also promised 60-70 backlinks daily, but personally, we find that hard to believe.

#### SunTec Link Building Tactics:

According to their website, they use directory guest post submissions to place links. The manager also mentioned using forums and blog comments (if you’re fine with getting a bunch of no-follow links).

#### Does SunTec Do Real Blogger Outreach?

They accepted our prospect list but we have our doubts about the 70 links/day part.

#### SunTec’s Own SEO:

Their DR is displayed as 31 with 3,900 organic traffic but it’s likely not accurate since Ahrefs warned us about their site being protected by a firewall.

#### Milkwhale’s Own SEO:

The Milkwhale website is protected by a security firewall, preventing Ahrefs from crawling it.

About Shortlist.io
Shortlist.io is the digital marketing team behind several successful businesses masterminded by their serial entrepreneur leader.
Shortlist’s CEO, Dave Schneider, has bootstrapped more than a few businesses, growing them significantly from 0 to multimillion exits.
Throughout this time, Dave has built a strong marketing team under his lead. After validating their strategies through multiple business cases, they decided to open their services to other businesses. However, they offer something different and much more custom than the typical agency model, and at a fair price.
Instead of a detached approach where businesses rarely interact with their contractors, they get to have involved partners. By hand picking the best fit for their business from Shortlist’s specialists, they can personally build their own outsourced digital marketing “dream team”, but without the hefty price tag associated with typical agencies.
What they do
Shortlist’s main bread and butter is white hat digital marketing. The Shortlist team has mastered their strategies and systems through multiple business successes, and can confidently replicate these for other clients.
Their services can all be broken down into four sub-offerings:
• Link building
• SEO services
• Web design and development
• Done for you marketing
How to contact them

Depending on the editorial guidelines of the website they’ll pitch it to, your anchor text can be modified in some way.
As the team of LightningRank posts on popular resources with busy editorial calendars, it can take up to three or four weeks for the article to go live.
