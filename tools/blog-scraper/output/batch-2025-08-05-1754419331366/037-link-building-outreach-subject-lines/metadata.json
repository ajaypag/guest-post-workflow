Create follow-up sequences\n‚Ä¢ Wrap up\nAs a link builder, SEO specialist, or sales rep, email marketing is a pivotal tool in your outreach arsenal.\nBut encouraging your audience to open your emails doesn‚Äôt always come easy ‚Ä¶ does it?\nWith other brands competing for your target customer‚Äôs attention, you may be constantly wondering how to position yourself to stand out among the rest.\nAnd while there‚Äôs no ‚Äúfool-proof‚Äù strategy for winning over a crowded inbox, the good news is you can do your best to get your foot in the door quicker.\nBy taking the time to thoroughly plan your email subject lines, you can stimulate curiosity, demonstrate benefits, and (if all goes well) nudge your recipients toward conversion.\nReady to learn more about how to create link building outreach subject lines that get opened?\nLet‚Äôs begin!\n\n## 1. Know Your Target Customer\n\nWhat kinds of brands will you be reaching out to and why? What industry are they in? What‚Äôs their company size? How can link building and recruitment marketing help them reach their brand visibility and authority goals?\nIn this step, get laser-clear on your target customer.\nThen, decide who you‚Äôll be reaching out to, specifically.\nWhich brings us to ‚Ä¶\n\n## 2. Create your link building outreach list\n\nTake a look at your Linkedin prospecting list, email list, outreach list, and CRM and decide which brands you‚Äôll be reaching out to. Start by choosing the hottest leads and then the warm ones. Fill out the rest of your list with relevant cold prospects.\nPro tip: When targeting cold leads, try asking for a small request first. As you build trust, you can start increasing your offer requests little by little.\nFor instance, if you wanted to offer link building services to a SaaS company, like PetScreening, you might ask if the team can meet with you for a brief 15 minute call before offering your services.\nOr, you could start the trust-building process early by sharing awesome results you helped other SaaS companies in the pet sector get. More on this in a bit.\n\n## 3. Understand Your Target Customer‚Äôs Core Needs (and how you can solve them with link building strategies)\n\nPutting yourself in your target customer‚Äôs shoes is essential to understanding what their core needs are and how you can fulfill them with your link building solutions.\nOnce you‚Äôre clear on how to meet their needs, you can create inspired and personalized subject lines with them in mind.\nFor instance, if you‚Äôd like to reach out to a credit card rewards company, you might discover that the company is struggling to convince high authority websites to feature its links. In this case, you can position yourself as an outreach expert that already has websites ready to feature the company‚Äôs links.\nOr if you want to reach out to a B2B cyber security brand specializing in advanced features like¬† DDoS protection, you might discover the brand is having trouble finding guest post writers that are well-versed in cyber security.\nIn this case, you can address its pain point head-on by sharing who on your team has ample experience writing guest posts for cybersecurity blogs.\n\n## 4. Improve Your Email Deliverability Rate\n\nImprove the chances of your email making it to your recipient‚Äôs inbox by following these email deliverability rate tips:\n‚Ä¢ Stay away from terms that could be flagged as spam (check with your email provider for a full list of spammy words)\n‚Ä¢ Use a professional email address that includes your first and last name\n‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt send from an email address that has a brand name, symbols, numbers, or inappropriate terms\n‚Ä¢ Add a headshot to your email profile ‚Äî it‚Äôll pop up next to your email address in the recipients inbox, demonstrating that you‚Äôre a real professional\n‚Ä¢ Use an email verification tool to scan and confirm that all of your recipient addresses are correct and active\n\n## 5. Conduct Research\n\nTo see which other subject lines have seen success, carve out time in your schedule to study articles, guides, and marketing books.\nYou might also consider attending training and seminars or taking a link building outreach course. You may need a SharePoint calendar to schedule these trainings if you‚Äôre going to take them as a group.\n\n## 6. Create your subject lines\n\nAnd finally, brainstorm and create your subject lines! When possible, personalize subject lines by addressing recipients by name ‚Äî or, at the very least, do so when you greet them in the email body.\nWhen creating your subject lines, keep your target customer, their core needs, and your research top-of-mind.\nHere are some subject lines you can refer to for inspiration.\n\n### Short and sweet curiosity builders\n\nGrab your audience‚Äôs attention with these short and sweet curiosity-building subject lines:\n‚Ä¢ Got a sec?\n‚Ä¢ Got links?\n‚Ä¢ Know HA sites?\n‚Ä¢ Re:\n‚Ä¢ (No subject)\n‚Ä¢ This is HUGE!\n‚Ä¢ Heads up\n‚Ä¢ Quick chat?\n‚Ä¢ Check-in\n‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll never believe‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¢ Hi!\n‚Ä¢ Hello\n‚Ä¢ Collab opportunity üôÇ\n\n### Sense of urgency/FOMO subject lines\n\nCreate a fear of missing out and a sense of urgency with the following subject lines:\n‚Ä¢ Why you can‚Äôt afford to ignore link building\n‚Ä¢ Link building webinar replay expires at midnight\n‚Ä¢ Today only: Free link building ebook available for download\n‚Ä¢ Spots are almost full: Have you booked your backlinks yet?\n‚Ä¢ New backlink clients get 20% off today only\n‚Ä¢ Last chance!

Test your subject lines\n\nAfter you‚Äôve brainstormed and created plenty of link building outreach subject line options, run A/B testing campaigns to discover which lines perform best.\nYou can also send out surveys and questionnaires, ask a focus group, or¬† hire¬† an experienced ¬†virtual assistant to handle testing for you.\n\n## 8. Create, finalize, and automate your campaigns\n\nOnce you have a feel for the subject lines that perform best, start creating, finalizing, and automating your outreach campaigns.\nSegment your campaigns by prospect type and schedule them to send automatically.\nThere‚Äôs a caveat here, though.\nWhile automating your campaigns is essential to streamlining your outreach processes, it‚Äôs vital to stay armed and ready to respond to and nurture prospects when you get a reply from them.\nIn other words, make sure you know how to continue the conversation effectively so you can nudge your prospect closer to the finish line ‚Äî otherwise known as conversion.\nAnd that brings us to ‚Ä¶\n\n## 9.

If you discover the target customer isn‚Äôt a good fit for your brand, consider removing them from your outreach list or spacing out your follow-up emails in case their needs change.\n\n## Wrap up\n\nEmail marketing is a pivotal tool in your outreach arsenal.\nBut that doesn‚Äôt mean that convincing your audience to open your emails comes easily.\nWith other brands on the hunt for your target customer‚Äôs attention, knowing how to stand out among the rest is crucial.
