That’s according to a report by DataReportal.\nAnd get this: The same report further indicates that internet usage numbers have only grown over the years.\nFor instance, the 5.52 billion recorded in 2024 is a significant 152 million increment from the previous year’s user base and over 300 million increase compared to internet users in 2022.\nSource\nSo, what do these numbers imply to business owners? It’s simple: The Internet is growing even more popular, and if there’s a time when entrepreneurs can’t afford to ignore the power of digital marketing, it is now.\nAnd actually, 60% of small business owners are already leveraging the power of digital marketing to attract customers and sales, signifying that the percentage of large business owners doing the same is even higher.\nBut then, with the number of those not using digital marketing expected to keep dwindling toward the zero mark, it’s essential to know the best way to leverage this powerful marketing tool to reach your target audience.\nThat gives rise to the question: What are some of the best ways to use digital marketing for your business?\nIf this is the question you’re grappling with, that’s what this article is all about. We’ll begin by examining what digital marketing is, its various types,  and how it can benefit your business. We’ll then provide digital marketing tips as shared by a digital marketing expert in the industry, equipping you with the insights you need to sharpen your digital marketing strategies for better results.\n\n## Understanding Digital Marketing\n\nBefore we dig into the nitty-gritty of today’s topic, let’s first begin by understanding what digital marketing encompasses.\nDigital marketing, sometimes referred to as online marketing, is a form of advertising that involves the use of the Internet and digital technologies to connect with customers. Many businesses now rely on professional digital publishing tools and online marketing services to strategize, implement, and optimize campaigns across various digital channels.”\nThis form of advertising is slowly taking the place of traditional media that involves the use of print, radio, television, and billboards to tell customers more about your business and the products you sell.\nDigital marketing is a powerful tool for businesses to attract and retain customers, which is why it has become an integral part of any marketing strategy. And with the rising number of internet users and their reliance on digital platforms, it has become more effective than ever.\n\n## Types of Digital Marketing\n\nDigital marketing is a broad term that encompasses various tactics and techniques to attract and retain customers.\nSome of the most common types of digital marketing include:\n• Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\n• Social media marketing\n• Content marketing\n• Email marketing\n• Pay-per-click advertising (PPC)\n• Affiliate marketing\nLet’s briefly examine each of these types and how they can benefit your business.\n\n### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) involves optimizing your content to rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs) and it’s part of organic marketing. Learning advanced SEO strategies, especially localized ones for cities like Denver, can significantly improve visibility and drive targeted traffic. The higher your content ranks on SERPs, the more your website becomes visible to the global internet audience, and thus, the more likely it is for your business to become known.\n81% of retail shoppers search the internet before buying something. When your content has a good ranking on SERPs, it becomes more likely for them to see it, increasing organic traffic to your website and improving your conversions.\nHowever, even if your content ranks well, slow website performance can significantly impact conversions – every 100 ms in added page load time costs 1% in revenue. Improving your site’s performance can increase organic traffic and improve your conversions.\n\n### Social Media Marketing\n\nAs internet usage grows, so does the use of social media. In fact, 5.17 billion people use social media, translating to 93.65% of those accessing the internet. This makes social media one of the most potent tools for digital marketing, which is where social media marketing comes in.\nSocial media marketing involves using social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn to promote your brand, products, or services – whether you’re a local shop owner or an event photographer showcasing your work. This form of marketing allows you to connect with potential customers on a more personal level and build brand loyalty.

This can include creating social media posts, videos, blog posts, infographics, podcasts, videos, and other forms of content that provide information or entertainment to potential customers. In today’s digital age, tools like LogoAI can help enhance your branding by generating professional marketing design materials for your brand.\nHowever, never forget that content marketing––like any other marketing channel–– is not going to drive conversions unless you nailed your product/market fit.\n\n### Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing involves sending promotional messages or newsletters through your email list to potential or existing customers. This form of marketing is highly effective in building customer relationships and driving sales. However, when engaging with email marketing, always ensure your links are secure by using a phishing link checker to avoid falling victim to malicious attacks. Implementing email verification before launching a campaign can also help maintain a clean mailing list, reduce bounce rates, and improve overall deliverability.\nEmail marketing is considered one of the most effective forms of digital marketing and is estimated to have a lucrative $36–$44 for every $1 spent. It has a high adoption rate, with 80% of businesses utilizing it as their marketing tool.\n\n### Pay-per-click Advertising (PPC)\n\nPPC advertising involves paying for each click on an online ad. These ads appear on search engine results pages, websites, and social media platforms. This form of marketing allows businesses to target specific audiences and track the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. Utilizing advanced tools like the SEMrush PPC toolkit can help businesses optimize their campaigns, identify high-performing keywords, and track ROI effectively.\n\n### Affiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing involves partnering with other businesses or individuals to promote your products or services on the condition that you will pay them a pre-agreed commission for every direct sale they make. This form of marketing allows you to expand your reach and attract new customers through these partnerships. Recent affiliate marketing statistics reveal trends and insights that help businesses tap into this channel effectively.\n\n## Top 5 Benefits of Digital Marketing\n\nSource\nDigital marketing has numerous that you can reap as a business. Let’s look at some of them:\n• A Wider Audience: Since it involves the use of the Internet, digital marketing opens you up to a large audience, improving your visibility and giving you more opportunities for sales, revenue, and business growth.\n• Lets You Target Specific Demographics: With effective digital marketing, you can identify and understand your online audience. With that understanding, you can tailor offers, messages, and content that resonates with the audience.\n• Trackable: When using digital marketing, you can easily know whether your campaign is paying off. There are numerous analytics tools out there that assess key performance metrics of your campaign, making it easy to have clear insights into the campaign you’re running.\n• Cost-Effective: Unlike traditional media, digital marketing has an impressive return on investment despite having a wider reach than its counterpart. But then, the ROI differs depending on the type of digital marketing you use.\n• Global Reach: Unlike traditional media limited by geographical factors, digital marketing gives you access to a global audience, improving your brand awareness and reach.\n\n## Expert Tips For Digital Marketing\n\nNow that you have the basics of digital marketing let’s dive deep and see how experts recommend carrying out digital marketing.\nHere are some top expert tips for digital marketing:\n\n### Leverage Data-Driven Decision Making\n\nAdvocating for a data-first approach to digital marketing, it is emphasized that “every click, view, and interaction tells a story.” Successful campaigns are not built on guesswork but on actionable insights. By analyzing metrics such as audience behavior, conversion rates, and engagement patterns, businesses can refine their strategies to maximize impact. And combined with project management tools, teams stay aligned throughout this process, ensuring insights are acted upon efficiently and timelines are met. Tools like Google Analytics, dbt cloud, heatmaps, marketing mix modeling, and A/B testing platforms can uncover what truly resonates with the audience, enabling businesses to allocate resources effectively and drive measurable results.\n\n### Unlocking the Power of Local with Geographical Landing Pages\n\nChad J. Treadway, Partner, and Chief Marketing Officer at Cube Creative Design, says, “Local Landing pages or geographical landing pages are powerful tools for businesses targeting local markets. By blending location-specific content with conversion-optimized design, these pages boost search visibility and resonate deeply with local audiences, turning area-specific searches into loyal customers.”\n\n### Implement Visual Management Tools to Track and Improve Productivity\n\nMarketing teams can tap into Agile project management methods such as using a Kanban software to keep track of their productivity and understand how to continuously improve their workflow. By leveraging the power of these tools, marketing teams can track the progress of their projects more efficiently and make sure that they can deliver their outputs in a timely manner.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDigital marketing is about building real connections in a digital world. It’s not just about tools or strategies—it’s about understanding your audience, showing up where they are, and delivering value they can’t ignore.\nSuccess comes from clarity, consistency, and adaptability. The experts agree: data should guide your decisions, content should spark engagement, and every effort should align with your goals. Digital marketing isn’t a shortcut; it’s a long game. But when done right, it’s a game-changer.\nNow’s the time to focus, refine your approach, and make every click count.\n\n## SEO and Link Building Resources\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## From Zero to Breakthrough: The Marketing Tactic That Made It Happen\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How Startups Are Winning with Real Tactics That Actually Convert\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How to Track Multiple Vehicles With Vehicle Tracking Software?\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How to Create a Content Marketing Strategy for eCommerce\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How to Choose the Best SEO Software for Your Business\n\n• Guides\n\n## Best Rank Tracking Tools for Local Businesses: What Actually Matters?\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## Best Digital Marketing Tips From Experts\n\n• Guides\n\n## Why Every Business Needs a Website\n\n• Guides\n\n## Using SEO For Lead Generation – Everything You Need To Know\n\n• Listicles\n\n## The Best Books To Learn SEO Recommended by Pros\n\n\n###### Curious?\n\n\n###### Let's talk LINKIO\n\n\n###### We love talking LINKIO.
