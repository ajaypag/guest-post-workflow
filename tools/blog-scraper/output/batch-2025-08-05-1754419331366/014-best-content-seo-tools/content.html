But SEO today is vastly different from what it used to be. Stuffing your content with keywords and adding backlinks left and right will not get you the results.
SEO, as it exists today, is a sophisticated technique that is influenced by the audience’s behavior. It is an amalgamation of both on-page and off-page tactics that help you rank higher on SERPs. And there are some great tools to help you with that.
In this article, we’ll be covering some excellent on-page and off-page SEO software that can help you achieve your growth objectives.

## What is on-page and off-page SEO?

A well-rounded SEO strategy comprises on-page SEO and off-page SEO. Think of them as two sides of the same coin. With on-page SEO techniques, you’ll be optimizing those sections (of your website) that you have control over.
The focus of on-page SEO is on producing good content with keyword optimization, the right title tags, and more. Utilizing an on-page SEO checker can help ensure that your website meets best practices by analyzing key factors like meta tags, headings, and content structure.
With off-page SEO, on the other hand, the focus is on increasing your website’s authority on the search engine results pages (SERPs) through various measures. Off-page SEO consists of link building, link exchange, and other techniques.
Both of these techniques are important for the success of an SEO campaign.
