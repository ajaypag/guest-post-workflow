Stuffing your content with keywords and adding backlinks left and right will not get you the results.\nSEO, as it exists today, is a sophisticated technique that is influenced by the audience’s behavior. It is an amalgamation of both on-page and off-page tactics that help you rank higher on SERPs. And there are some great tools to help you with that.\nIn this article, we’ll be covering some excellent on-page and off-page SEO software that can help you achieve your growth objectives.\n\n## What is on-page and off-page SEO?\n\nA well-rounded SEO strategy comprises on-page SEO and off-page SEO. Think of them as two sides of the same coin. With on-page SEO techniques, you’ll be optimizing those sections (of your website) that you have control over.\nThe focus of on-page SEO is on producing good content with keyword optimization, the right title tags, and more. Utilizing an on-page SEO checker can help ensure that your website meets best practices by analyzing key factors like meta tags, headings, and content structure.\nWith off-page SEO, on the other hand, the focus is on increasing your website’s authority on the search engine results pages (SERPs) through various measures. Off-page SEO consists of link building, link exchange, and other techniques.\nBoth of these techniques are important for the success of an SEO campaign.\n\n## Best On-Page and Off-Page SEO Tools\n\n\n### 1. Narrato\n\nThis all-in-one tool for content creators comes with a great AI writing and SEO tool that’s excellent for optimizing your content for greater visibility even as you write.

You can also add your own keywords while creating a new content piece on Narrato Workspace.\nNarrato also provides an AI writer, which auto-generates content for a variety of use cases. Use it for your blogs, copies, emails, video, or even SEO copy and meta descriptions. If you’re looking for a tool that can simplify all your content needs (content creation, optimization, collaboration, planning), Narrato is your answer.\nPricing: Teams that are just starting out can use Narrato for free.
