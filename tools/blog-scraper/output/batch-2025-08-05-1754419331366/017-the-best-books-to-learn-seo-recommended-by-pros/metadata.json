They can lead you from A to Z of search engine optimization: from SEO definitions and fundamentals to some senior-class tactics on how to optimize for conversions and little-known secrets of SEO.\nTake out your magic wand and repeat after me: Revelio.\n(Now, I am kidding. Just a huge Harry Potter fan )\nSo, to the list!\n\n## Top Books on Search Engine Optimization\n\nRead the greatest books about SEO, with all its secrets and pitfalls. They have become the most important sources of knowledge for business leaders, founders, and managers who used them as guideposts in optimizing their websites for search engines.\n\n## SEO for Beginners\n\nSubtitle: Learn the basics of SEO in under 3 hours!\nAuthor: Mark Northwell\nNumber of pages: 99\n\n#### What it covers\n\nAre you a newcomer to the world of search engine optimization?\nThen this beginner’s guide to SEO is the first book to ease you into it.\nThe author makes it clear why everyone optimizes for search engines today, how your site operates, or what “creatures” crawl your web pages and index them without you even noticing it. He also provides a complete list of keyword research tools that become handy to anyone trying to SEO their way to success.\nAnd that is not all. You’ll get more SEO fundamentals.\n99 pages divided by three hours = 33 pages per hour. What do you think? Can you manage it?\n\n#### Whose recommendation is it?\n\nJerry Han, CMO at PrizeRebel:\n“I say, always start with the basics. And this SEO book can help you do that. It explains why SEO challenges you first but then lets you reap the rewards. More importantly, it teaches you the essentials to help you put your foot on the grounds of the SEO kingdom.\nWhat I liked the best – Mark Northwell doesn’t overwhelm you with technical details or complicated terms. He walks you through a simple and highly understandable guide.”\n\n## 3 Months to No.1\n\nSubtitle: The “No-Nonsense” SEO Playbook for Getting Your Website Found on Google\nAuthor: Will Coombe\nNumber of pages: 247\n\n#### What it covers\n\nImagine you’re giving someone your brand-new website and asking them to bring you the first page results on Google in just three months.\nThis someone is Will Coombe, and in this book on SEO, he demonstrates how he’d do this for you.\nBy erecting the four pillars of SEO, of course:\n• Pillar #1. Relevance\n• Pillar #2. Crawlability\n• Pillar #3. Engagement\n• Pillar #4. Authority\nUnder his guidance, you’ll learn how to find relevant target keywords, make it easy for Google to inspect your pages, boost user engagement, increase domain authority, and more.\n\n#### Whose recommendation is it?\n\nJesse Hanson, Content Manager at Online Solitaire and Word of Card Games:\n“SEO always seemed a complicated game for my understanding because I didn’t know its basic rules. Until I learned those from Will Coombe, a co-founder of the UK’s leading SEO agency, in this playbook.\nThe major revelation, however, was that nobody truly knows how to game Google. And it’s more like a cat-and-mouse game between this search engine and SEO pros. There are no super-fast hacks, but there’s hard work and certain steps to be taken.”\n\n## SEO Help\n\nSubtitle: 20 Practical Steps to Power Your Content Creation, Marketing and Branding in the New AI World of Google Search\nAuthor: David Amerland\nNumber of pages: 198\n\n#### What it covers\n\nIn SEO Help, David Amerland talks about 20 SEO aspects you should know and apply in practice. For example, voice search, structured data, YouTube SEO, podcasting, hashtagging, etc.\nIn one of the chapters, he particularly outlines the role of AI in SEO and the perspectives it opens in front of businesses. He establishes the connection between artificial intelligence and semantic search and names the 4Vs of big data:\n• Volume\n• Variety\n• Velocity\n• Veracity\nRemarkably, all chapters end with action checklists.\n\n#### Whose recommendation is it?\n\nJesse Galanis, Content Manager at Tech Lockdown:\n“My top pick among the best books for learning SEO is the fourth edition of SEO Help published in 2020. The first edition came out in 2010. Since then, SEO has changed a lot. That’s why the author updated this release and added tons of fresh content to it.\nInterestingly, every chapter is like a standalone book describing a specific SEO topic. You shouldn’t necessarily read chapters one by one. You can skip those you don’t need and move to the part that kindles your interest most.”\n\n## Link Building Is Dead\n\nSubtitle: Long Live Link Building!\nAuthor: Sage Lewis\nNumber of pages: 216\n\n#### What it covers\n\nSo, link building is dead, right?\nSo wrong.\nWould you like to see that it’s actually more than alive?\nSage Lewis proves that by examples and case studies of Walmart, Catster & Dogster, and others. Obama’s link-building strategy, for instance, fueled his victory in the elections. You can also get easy backlinks just like other companies did. See how exactly in the book.\nBesides, the author doesn’t let you forget about a social media link-building strategy you might need to develop right now to win the competition.\n\n#### Whose recommendation is it?\n\nFernando Lopez, Marketing Director at Circuit:\n“It’s one of the must-read SEO books on link building and its peculiarities. It makes you rethink your approach to getting backlinks. A link builder should be a PR professional, in the first place, not a spammer. That’s the key lesson I learned from this book.”\n\n## SEO Workbook\n\nSubtitle: Search Engine Optimization Success in Seven Steps\nAuthor: Jason McDonald\nNumber of pages: 360\n\n#### What it covers\n\nSEO is power.

His SEO workout book has taught me how to optimize effectively to get any website in an SEO-healthy shape. I like the comparison he uses in this guidebook. SEO is like physical fitness which requires discipline and smart work, not hard work.”\n\n## Ecommerce SEO\n\nSubtitle: An Advanced Guide to On-page Search Engine Optimization for Ecommerce\nAuthor: Traian Neacsu\nNumber of pages: 400\n\n#### What it covers\n\nLooking for the best books on SEO to learn how to optimize your eCommerce or dropshipping business website?\nLook no further.\nThis guide is all you need to grasp how eCommerce SEO works and use this knowledge to your benefit.
