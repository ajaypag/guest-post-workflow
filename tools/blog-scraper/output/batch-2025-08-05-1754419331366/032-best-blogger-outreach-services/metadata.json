Internet Marketing Ninjas\n• Other Blogger Outreach Agencies We Considered\n• Tips When Hiring a Blogger Outreach Agency\n• Questions to Ask a Blogger Outreach Company\n• Closing Thoughts\nWhich blogger outreach services should you use for link building?\nSo. Many. Options.\nIs it Outreach Labs? Fat Joe? Stellar? Another link outreach agency that you haven’t heard of?\nThe wrong choice means wasting 6 months of time and burning thousands of marketing dollars.\nThe right choice means more rankings, traffic, revenue and growth.\nLet me help you decide.\nGo through my research of 17 blog outreach agencies.\n> I reviewed their response speed, process, tactics, pricing and quality.\nI reviewed their response speed, process, tactics, pricing and quality.\nNext I’ll go over key factors that’ll help you make the right blog outreach service choice.\nFinally, I’ll help you make a decision and give you my final verdict on who is the best.\nLet’s start!\n\n## 1. Outreach Labs\n\n\n### Outreach Labs Review:\n\nOutreach Labs builds relationships that earn links. By doing focused outreach to corporate blogs, industry-known blogs or personal blogs, they’ve come up with unique processes and link building strategies that consistently deliver high end links at affordable prices.\nThey have a team of experienced link builders, project managers, and developers who are dedicated to providing the best possible service and experience.\nTheir main strategies include guest posting, ghost written posts, and link insertions. These strategies are beneficial in helping to increase traffic, build relationships, and improve domain authority.\nIf their first response is a price sheet, they’re simply not interested. This separates them from their competitors and allows them to offer ultra competitive rates. Try out their link building service today!\n\n### Outreach Labs Response Speed:\n\nWe respond within 24 hours or you can easily schedule a free consult through our dashboard.\n\n### Outreach Labs Link Building Tactics:\n\nOutreach Labs’ link building tactics are guest posting, ghostwritten posts, and link insertions. Overall, they stay away from strategies that rely on paying bloggers for links.\nInstead, they focus on two things – building up a history of creating good content that bloggers covet and having bloggers owe them one.\nThese two factors combined are all that’s needed to generate great backlinks consistently.\n\n### Outreach Labs Pricing Policy:\n\nTheir packages start at $1499. You choose a monthly budget and they build a range of links within that package. Each link is assigned a monetary value based on the DR, traffic and type of links it is. For example, if they score mostly high end links a particular month, the total links delivered will be less than if they’d scored mostly medium-authority links.\n\n### Does Outreach Labs Do Real Blogger Outreach?\n\nThey absolutely do! They target links from blogs with a content manager, content marketers, traffic-having niche sites, or in general, picky blogs.\nFramed in another way, they do not believe links are valuable or worth building if they come from a blogger with a price sheet, a blog with no editor, an obvious link seller, a general blog with no traffic or a guest posts only blog.\n\n## 2. LinkBuilder.io\n\n\n### LinkBuilder.io Review:\n\nLinkBuilder.io is a link building agency that focuses on high-end link building services. Their focus is on developing a custom link building strategy for each of their clients, placing a strong emphasis on competitor analysis to figure out what the right approach is for your website.\n\n### LinkBuilder.io Response Speed:\n\nResponse speed is within 24 hours, and they also have a dashboard area where you can log in manually to order services, which makes for a convenient experience.\n\n### LinkBuilder.io Link Building Tactics:\n\nLinkBuilder.io’s link building tactics including relationship-based link building, guest posts and link insertions. They’re incredibly strict when it comes to link quality, and frequently blog about common issues within the industry such as low-quality links farms and PBNs.\nThey strive to only earn links from real websites with strong organic traffic, who adhere to their own high quality editorial standards.\n\n### LinkBuilder.io Pricing Policy:\n\nTheir monthly packages start at $5999 per month which includes a fully managed link building service and guarantees a number of links each month.\nHowever, they also have a ‘Pay per link’ option which allows those with a lower budget to acquire links on an ad-hoc basis.\nThey also have minimum standards when it comes to the DR and traffic of a website they’re earning a link from.\n\n### Does LinkBuilder.io Do Real Blogger Outreach?\n\nThey do. They target blogs & websites that have strong editorial standards, and don’t shy away from attempting to earn placements and links on really high-end sites that are difficult to convince.\nThey share case studies on their website which also showcase some examples of the sites they’re able to land links on. From our analysis, those sites all looked to be very high quality.\n\n### LinkBuilder.io’s Own SEO:\n\nThey have a DR score of 58 and over 8,000 organic visitors per month. Their website design is appealing and they frequently blog thought-leadership content around link building.\n\n## 3.

Even after a follow-up. But, since Page One Power specializes in custom link building, we’re sure that outreach to a custom list of prospects is well in their range of capabilities.\n\n### Page One Power ’s Own SEO:\n\nThe Page One Power website is well-optimized and has 67 DR along with 4,800 organic visitors per month.\n\n## 4. Linkshero\n\n\n### Linkshero Review:\n\nThe amount (and quality) of backlinks pointing to your site is a top factor for your website’s success. The problem is – white hat link building is always an ungrateful and daunting process because the conversion rates are so low.\nYes, there is A LOT of rejection.\nIn fact, for every 100 leads, you’d get approximately 3 links.

Heroic Search\n\n\n#### Heroic Search Review:\n\nHeroic Search link building services are centered around manual outreach, as well as relationship building. Their team frequently uses over a dozen tactics to earn links to clients in a variety of industries.\nThey have relationships with editors, bloggers, journalists, and even other agencies. When these two methods are combined, they present a strong force that results in high-quality links for even the most difficult niches and assignments. Offerings include monthly link building campaigns, as well as one-off packages.\n\n#### How to Order from Heroic Search:\n\nOrdering from Heroic Search is rather simple. All you have to do is fill out an online questionnaire with a few simple questions. That includes your name, email address, which link building tactics do you agree on using, and how many links do you actually want to be built.\n\n#### Heroic Search Pricing Policy:\n\nUnlike a lot of other link building companies, Heroic Search doesn’t make their prices depending on metrics like Domain Authority. Instead, the prices of their services are determined by how competitive your niche is.\nThey range from $300/link for low-competition niches like sports and arts to $450/link for legal, real estate, health, and other highly competitive niches.\n\n#### Heroic Search Link Building Tactics:\n\nAs for the tactics they use, they include guest posting, broken link building, expired domain redirects, image link building, sponsorship link building, and more.\n\n#### Does Heroic Search Do Real Blogger Outreach?\n\nThey agreed on using our own list of prospects to reach out to, but also suggested that the results might not be as good as if they filtered out their own prospects as well. So, they offered to do outreach to both our prospects and their own to get the most out of the campaign.\n\n#### Heroic Search Response Speed:\n\nIt only took them about 20 minutes to reply as well, which is a sign of incredible organization.\n\n#### Heroic Search’s Own SEO:\n\nTheir Domain Rating sits at 62 with the amount of organic traffic capping out at 62 visits monthly as well.\n\n## Tips When Hiring a Blogger Outreach Agency\n\n\n### Should you outsource blogger outreach or do it inhouse?\n\nEven the best blogger outreach agencies need time to succeed.\nOutsourcing is not for you unless you can comfortably fund 6 months worth of activity.\nIf you have more time than budget, try learning how to build links instead.\nYou can eventually hire your own freelancers on Upwork and build tons of great links for less.\nIf you have the budget, outsourcing has its benefits as well.\nOutreach companies already have processes and trained staff to act fast.\nThey’ve got established connections with top bloggers, making securing quality placements easier.\n\n### Types of blogger outreach agencies\n\nI place agencies into 3 buckets: scammers, bulk, and personalizers.\n\n#### 1. Scammer outreach agencies\n\nThey promise blogger outreach campaigns but deliver private blog network or guest post farm links.\nTip offs:\n• pricing below $100 per link\n• sharing website lists with you,\n• having fast turn around times on each link\nThese type of services no longer have a place in SEO in my opinion.\n\n#### 2. Bulk outreach agencies\n\nIt’s a numbers game for bulk outreach agencies.\nSending 1000’s of templated emails hoping for a decent response rate.\nSuccess depends on how compelling the template is.\nOffering $1000 for a link will get you responses for sure.\nPitching a generic guest post won’t.\nTemplates aren’t bad if the outreach agency knows what their doing.\nA less personalized but killer value proposition template will drive plenty responses.\nGood examples:\n• Free access to a tool in exchange for a link\n• High end link in exchange for a link\n• Large social media visibility in exchange for a link\nBad examples:\n• I would like to contribute a fresh, high-quality, article for your website at zero cost.\n• I need a guest post on your website how much is your price for each post.\nNot a fan of templates offering to pay for links.\nMost responses come from worthless blogs because quality bloggers ignore such emails.\nAsk your prospective agency about their templates to see how advanced they are (or aren’t).\n\n#### 3. Personalized Outreach Agencies\n\nPersonalized outreach agencies claim they personalize every step of their email outreach.\n• Manually finding relevant bloggers.\n• Manually finding the right contact person per website.\n• Manually writing a unique outreach email.\n• Following up across several channels like email, Linkedin, and Twitter.\nBenefit include a higher response rates from high authority bloggers.\nDownside is pricing. You’ll pay more per link as labor costs are higher.\n\n### Do blogger outreach companies still work?\n\nHaving success with blog outreach isn’t easy anymore.\nGoogle is smarter. There’s more competition.\nHowever, outsourcing your blogger outreach can still work depending on these factors:\n\n#### 1. State of your website\n\nIt work best on authoritative sites that are SEO-optimized.\nThe same campaign probably fails on lesser websites.\nA good outreach agency discusses those factors with you beforehand.\nOthers will gloss over it, take your money and deliver links that’ll do nothing.\n\n#### 2. Backlink quality\n\nWhat’s better?\n• 10 links from niche relevant blogs OR 100 links from generalist blogs?\n• 10 links from high traffic blogs or 100 links from low traffic blogs?\n• 10 links from influential bloggers or 100 links from “admin”?\n• 10 links that generate referral traffic or 100 links that generate none?\nI can go on but you get the idea.\nA real blogger outreach program delivers the former while most blog outreach services do the latter.\n\n### Is it safe to use a blogger outreach service?\n\nLink building is dangerous.\nA Google link penalty that sets your business back months is not a rare thing.\nYear after year, Google updates are getting better at penalizing spammy links and aggressive anchor text.\nBlogger outreach companies need to prove they deliver real links with proper strategy.\n• Ask for case studies and link samples.\n• Ask how they approach natural anchor text.\n• Ask how they evaluate blogs.\n• Ask about their buying backlinks policy.\n• Ask how they evaluate backlink profiles.\n\n### How much do blogger outreach agencies cost?\n\nHere’s a good framework for evaluating the monthly pricing of blogger outreach agencies.\nTake their monthly fee and divide it by how many links they’ll deliver.\nFor example, if its $2000 a month for 10 links, then its $200 per link. $4000 for 10 links is $400.\nHere are a few insights you can gleam now:\n\n#### Below $100 per link\n\nProbably means not links from genuine websites with traffic.\nI’d guess they’re creating content for $10, paying a blog partner $15 to publish and pocketing the rest.\nMeh.\n\n#### $150-$250 per link\n\nThis is the realm of bulk outreach agencies.\nThey’ll send hundreds of emails knowing some genuine websites will respond.\nResponse rate depend on how good the value proposition is in the email template.\n\n#### $300-$400 per link\n\nBlogger outreach providers who promise real personalization come in at this price point.\nIf the company is charging this amount and not personalizing, you’re better off in the $150-$250 tier.\n\n## Questions to Ask a Blogger Outreach Company\n\nIf you’re at a loss when trying to evaluate a blogger outreach agency, here’s are some questions to ask.\n\n### Evaluating their backlink quality\n\n• Do they deliver real websites?\n• What metrics do you use for backlink quality evaluation? Ahrefs DR, Moz Domain Authority, Ahrefs traffic.\n• How do you weed out spammy sites? Do you check monthly traffic?\n\n### Evaluating their outreach process\n\n• What types of blogger outreach do you do?\n• Do you use blog outreach software?\n• What’s their manual outreach strategy? Are they natural links?\n• What’s their approach to blogger outreach? How do they build a relationship with bloggers?\n• What’s their outreach process like? Is it genuine outreach?\n• Who does the outreach efforts? Is it outreach teams?\n• How do they target key influencers? What’s the blogger outreach journey look like?\n• How do you evaluate my website for link readiness? Do you do content evaluation?\n\n### Evaluating their content quality\n\n• What types of content do they deliver?\n• Who are the content writers?\n• Who comes up with the content ideas?\n• Do clients have a say in the content topics?\n• What’s your content creation strategy?\n• Do you include additional relevant links in the content?\nThis may seem like a lot to ask but you can learn a lot from their answers.\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nChoosing the right blogger outreach service provider isn’t as easy as going with the top agency on this list.\nIt’ll come down to your budget, expertise and current state of your site.\nHopefully this “what to look for” framework + list of blog outreach agencies helps get you closer to your decision.\nBest of luck to picking the perfect link outreach partner and getting those juicy rankings.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nChoosing the right blogger outreach service provider isn’t as easy as going with the top agency on this list.\nIt’ll come down to your budget, expertise and current state of your site.\nHopefully this “what to look for” framework + list of blog outreach agencies helps get you closer to your decision.\nBest of luck to picking the perfect link outreach partner and getting those juicy rankings.\nGet in Touch\n\n## SEO and Link Building Resources\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## From Zero to Breakthrough: The Marketing Tactic That Made It Happen\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How Startups Are Winning with Real Tactics That Actually Convert\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How to Track Multiple Vehicles With Vehicle Tracking Software?\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How to Create a Content Marketing Strategy for eCommerce\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## How to Choose the Best SEO Software for Your Business\n\n• Guides\n\n## Best Rank Tracking Tools for Local Businesses: What Actually Matters?\n\n• Case Studies\n\n## Best Digital Marketing Tips From Experts\n\n• Guides\n\n## Why Every Business Needs a Website\n\n• Guides\n\n## Using SEO For Lead Generation – Everything You Need To Know\n\n• Listicles\n\n## The Best Books To Learn SEO Recommended by Pros\n\n\n###### Curious?\n\n\n###### Let's talk LINKIO\n\n\n###### We love talking LINKIO.
