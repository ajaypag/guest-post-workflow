It will find the email addresses of people either individually or in bulk. It is a Cloud-based email search solution that helps businesses find emails on company websites, verify domains, compose follow-ups, and more.\nHunter Email Finder uses the most complete database of public email addresses to find the right contact information and everything goes to verification first before being returned to the searcher. Email addresses with a green shield passed its verification and so the searcher can use them safely.\nIf the email addresses cannot be validated, Hunter will provide a confidence score on the returned email to help and guide the user on how sure and accurate the email address is.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nThere is a free version of Hunter that gives its users 25 searches/month with limited access. The good thing about it is, a search is only counted if you get results. You will also get 50 verifications for free each month.\nThe paid version has 4 tiers and will give users full access to the product. It can be billed either monthly or annually (with a 30% discount)\n• Starter\n• Growth\n• Pro\n• Enterprise\nStarter Tier is priced at $49/mo if billed monthly and $34/mo if on yearly billing. This gives the customer 500 searches and 1000 verifications per month.\nGrowth Tier is priced at $99/mo on monthly billing and $69/mo if billed yearly. It provides the user with 2500 searches and 500 verifications per month.\nPro Tier will cost $199/mo if billed monthly and $139/mo for yearly billing. This will give the user 10000 searches and 20000 verifications each month.\nEnterprise Tier is priced at $399/mo on monthly billing and $279/mo with yearly billing. It will also allow the customer to have 30000 searches and 60000 verifications per month.\nUnlike other products, there are no Extended or Plus versions for each tier. You have to upgrade to the next tier if the need arises. It will cost you double the price but on the positive side, it will give you double the value of the searches and verifications.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nThe free version is really good! Many Hunter users have never really paid or upgraded to the paid version. The free searches and verifications are sufficient especially if you are not a heavy user of the email finder.\nThe interface is very easy and simple to use even for a non-techy person. Of course, there are better ones in the market, but you will also have to shell out some dollars for that.\nThe great thing about Hunter is that you can click the extension and it’ll even have their titles with their emails and phone number.

In this sense, it can be prone to abuse in sending spam marketing and email communication.\nAnother aspect is the pricing. There is no PLUS or expandable version for each price tier. If your need fluctuates, you have to cancel your current tier and buy the next tier or the lower tier. Also, the paid plan starts on a higher-end which makes it a pricey option if opting for the paid plan.\nEmail verifications need improvement, based on user feedback. Sometimes it isn’t able to confirm the email verification or create false positives. So if you’re using it, be cautious and make sure to double-check the results before sending email to the recipients.\nIt doesn’t work with Linkedin and other Social Media applications.\n\n## RocketReach\n\n\n### General Features\n\nFor use in Sales, Marketing and Recruitment.

All the team members will share the credits provided in the plan.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nThis tool uses credits whether or not the email bounces. If in case you didn’t have many prospects to find their email address, your subscription might be wasted because the usage counter resets every month.\nOther users also encounter a lot of duplicate email addresses, sometimes this tool generated invalid or old emails. Sometimes Getprospect is not able to pull email addresses from LinkedIn profiles.\nTheir Customer support is oftentimes slow to respond and unable to resolve simple issues right away. Sometimes it takes 2 weeks to respond to queries.\n\n## Apollo\n\n\n### General Features\n\nApollo is a chrome extension that can be placed in your main browser window, within LinkedIn, your email, CRM, or your company websites. This will provide you easy access and at the same time deep research on companies and contacts while providing you with their email addresses and contact numbers.\nApollo is built to help you hit your desired email target. It tool gathers verified email addresses & phone numbers directly from Linkedin and syncs them with your CRM directly. It gets the mobile number of your prospect for a higher connect rate.\nYou can find the best contacts at each company and users have the option to search by name, job title, or location. It uses a 5-step email verification process increasing its accuracy.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nIn terms of cost, you have the option either to be billed monthly or annually, with annual billing giving you a 10 – 20 dollars discount.\nThere is a Free Version that will provide you with 50 credits/month. It already has LinkedIn and Gmail extensions and is also integrated into HubSpot and SalesForce. You can export files to CSV although you have limited API access.\nThe Basic Version costs $49/month and $39 if you opted to be billed annually. This will give you all the perks of the Free Version plus other additional benefits like unlimited email sending and filters for easy search, and many more.\nIt will also provide you with 200 monthly credits, whether you choose to have monthly or annual billing. The good thing is that new users will have a 14-day trial period (which most of the other email finders do not offer).\nThe Professional Version will cost you $99/month which goes down to $79/month if you choose to be billed annually. There is no limit for email credits and will give you the extra benefit of being able to search for mobile numbers as well.\nThe same with the Basic version, this also has a 14-day trial.\nApollo also offers Custom Versions to its clients, depending on their needs. It will include all of the benefits from the Professional version, and the customized request from the client. However, billing is on annual option only and you have to contact their Sales Support team to discuss further the details.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nApollo UI is clean and easy to understand. According to some feedback from its clients, its UI and UX are one the best in the market and the filters are a great addition and are very helpful. Many users commented that their CS Support is great, replying immediately to queries while providing immediate resolution to customer difficulties!\nTheir integration with LinkedIn, Hubspot and Salesforce draws most of their customers to subscribe to Apollo as it is very efficient, accurate and reliable.\nAnother feature that you will like about Apollo is the 14-day trial period, in their paid versions. Most other email finders will offer you the trial period in their most basic or in their free-trial version which is very limited in benefits and access.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nJust remember that Apollo charges you per user. So, say, your boss just wants to log in to view your activity or to check and track your progress, you have to purchase him a separate subscription.\nThe tool can be quite slow at times when navigating from one window to another.  Some of the contact numbers and even emails are not updated.\nWhile the general feedback is about great UI, the dashboard is quite intimidating especially for new users and beginners, with some commenting on higher learning curve in using the application.\n\n## FindThatEmail\n\n\n### General Features\n\nIt claimed to be the Yellow Pages of Email. It uses a Chrome extension that works instantly right from your browser. You can use it to find and prospect emails from social networks like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter. It can also be used as a bulk email finder where you can search email addresses from a list of names and companies or domains.\nBefore calling an email valid, the email verification engine requires that at least two sources flag it as valid, we do that to outsmart Catch-All addresses. Clients can also use Zapier to connect Find That Email with more than 500+ integrations available, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Mailchimp and Pipedrive.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nHere’s the thing, NO YEARLY PLANS! As the powers-that-be at Find That Email believes that users should be able to cancel their subscription whenever they want.\nThere are 5 options for users to choose from:\nThe FreeTrial, Starter, Pro, Teams, and Custom.\nCharges are the same across the board, however, the number of credits may vary, as clients can choose whether to buy the BUNDLE Plan, FIND Plans, OR VERIFY Plans. That’s right, they charge and allocate Find credits and Verify credits SEPARATELY.\nLet’s examine the Bundle Plan.\n\nFor the Free Trial, the user needs to sign up and will be given 100 Verify credits and 50 Find credits per month, with very limited access.\nThe Starter costs $29/month and will provide the user with 750 Verify Credits and 250 Find Credits.\nYou can also use the application for Bulk Finding and will have Social Networks Support and Integrations. However, there is no API Access and credits are not transferable.\nThe Pro is priced at $79/month with 5,000 Verify Credits and 1,000 Find Credits. It has all the perks of the Starter plan and the additional benefit of transferring credits as it will allow you to create 2 users.\nTeams will cost $149/month and will allow Unlimited users and transferable credits. Clients will enjoy 15,000 Verify Credits and 3,000 Find Credits while having all of the benefits including API Access.\nFor the Custom, the cost will range from $249 to $2499 per month, with 25,000 Verify credits and 5,000 Find credits to 500,000 Verify credits and 100,000 Find credits per month, respectively. You can choose the option by yourself without contacting its Sales Dept as it can be done on their website itself.\nAs mentioned, the charges in all plans stay the same. However, the credits will change.\nIn Find Plans, the Starter is 500 find credits, the Pro is 2,000 Find credits and Teams have 6,000 creditsIn Verify Plans, the Starter option will allocate the user with 1,500 Verify credits, Pro will have 10,000 Verify credits and the Teams option will have 30,000 Verify credits.\nCustomers have the option to either pay by Credit Card or Paypal. Users also can switch plans at any time they want and the credits from the old plan will get added to the new plan.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nMost of the feedback from users mentioned that its email scraping was top notch and 90% of the time delivered valid email addresses. Customer support is very fast, their email verification tool is very accurate.\nFind That Email gives a confidence score and gives its users an idea if the email address is accurate and if it can impact their email bounce rate. A lot of the companies deduct credits for searching while Find That Email ONLY deducts a credit when an email address is found and that is cool! They also offer a 14 days money-back no-questions-asked guarantee to new subscribers.\nCustomer support also is highly rated by the users, with a prompt response and easy to contact as primary reasons.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nSome users’ experience searching using LinkedIn Chrome extension is very slow compared to other tools.  Some competitors have a lower price per contact when compared. However, its high accuracy rate and overall efficiency compensate for it.\nThe free trial doesn’t allow the user to try out all the options available within the paid plans. It would have been great if the free trial would grant this access so that new subscribers can actually “get the feel” of the application. As a would-be user, you would like to have a chance to test out all the features before you decide to upgrade your account to the paid version, right?\n\n## LeadGibbon\n\n\n### General Features\n\nLeadGibbon is a cloud-based software that generates reliable and verified contact information for businesses that aim to build and manage a B2B client database to generate sales leads.\nThe software helps users build a robust contact list quickly with the LeadGibbon Google Chrome extension, which allows you to find the email address of any lead on LinkedIn Sales Navigator and export this data to the CRM software you use.\nLeadGibbon gives you access to over 20 million contact records and over 1000+ companies.

When you use their chrome extension or email enricher, you’ll get email addresses that have a less than 99% chance of being delivered for Free.\nPricing is pretty straightforward. There are no contracts needed, meaning no annual subscriptions. You can cancel anytime and your billing is on a monthly basis only. There are 3 plans to choose from. BASIC, PRO, and BUSINESS.\nBasic Plan is priced at $49 a month and has 1000 monthly credits.\nPro Plan is priced at $99 a month with 5000 monthly credits.\nBusiness Plan costs $199 per month and has 20000 monthly credits available.\nUnlike its many competitors, they don’t have a custom plan. However, they do have a free trial to which you will receive 5 free credits. Would-be customers will have a chance to take their database for a spin and decide whether it’s the right fit for them.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nThe simplicity of integration with LinkedIn and Chrome is one of the reasons why clients use LeadGibbon. Many commented that the user interface is very easy to use, and the ability of it to be saved and shared with team members makes it an easy choice for new subscribers. Users are not bogged down by long data loading times as data processing is done in the backend.\nIt is fairly easy and seamless to use while on LinkedIn. Easy access and organized results in a live google sheet. Having all the details in one Google Sheet makes it easier to manage leads through a sales funnel – which isn’t available on Sales Navigator.\nLeadGibbon offers the same benefits across the different plans. So, whether you have a Basic plan, you still have access to all features.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nLeadGibbons’ accuracy is NOT as high as some of the more expensive competitors in the market, but it is better than the other cheaper Chrome extension tools out there! Some reviews mentioned that it is a bit on the expensive side compared to other solutions in this category. It is worthy to note that while you can export data in a CSV file and share it thru Google sheets, it would be an improvement if leads could be saved in a selected worksheet within the Google Sheet.\n\n## AeroLeads\n\n\n### General Features\n\nAeroleads helps you to find verified business emails of your prospects and leads with their job title, company, website, location, LinkedIn URL. Users will have the ability to export the data to CSV or transfer data to Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, FreshSales or Zapier with just one click.\nIt is a powerful Prospecting and Sales Intelligence software that works with sites like LinkedIn, Crunchbase, AngelList as well as you can upload your lists.

However, you can use the free accounts as much as you want but they do have limitations on usage, results and do not allow features like exporting data to other services like MailChimp, HubSpot and salesforce.\nThere are four aptly named plans you can choose from: Take Off, Climb, Cruise, and Enterprise.\nTake Off Plan starts at $49 a month. The user will have 1000 credits that can be used to find emails, find prospects from LinkedIn, Crunchbase, or Angellist. You can also import and export data to CSV, however, you cannot transfer data to Salesforce, HubSpot or Zapier.\nClimb Plan will cost $149 a month.

Simply have the plugin downloaded and you can immediately get things rolling. Its dashboard is squeaky clean. With it, you’re able to make lists and export them into a CSV to be uploaded to your own CRM.\nWhile other tools in the market asked you to pay separately for contact or phone numbers, Aeroleads will provide it to their clients for free (or included in the credits) which is an additional benefit.\nAlso, customer support is nice and efficient and replies within minutes.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nPricing can be improved and data accuracy which is claimed to be 100 percent accurate, needs some substantial change.\nIt takes time for bulk search but future updates might improve the performance. The phone numbers are sometimes corporate phone numbers of the company and not the office desk phone numbers of that prospect.\n\n## Kendo Email App\n\n\n### General Features\n\nKendo Email Finder will find, verify, and save the leads with enriched data, including name, role, company and emails.\nIts email finder chrome extension will find the contact enriched data with a single click.

Customers can be billed either monthly or yearly for the paid plan and there are four plans you can choose from.\nStarter Plan costs $14/mo and $12/mo on yearly billing.

All of these come with unlimited users.\nAs the name implies, Corp10k allocates 10000 emails, Corp20k, allocates 20000 emails, Corp50k allocates 50000 emails. A custom plan is designed for higher volumes of email search allocations.\nCORP10K is priced at $149 a month. CORP20k is at $249 a month. CORP50k will cost $499 a month. The Custome plan needs to be discussed with their Sales team for pricing and quotation.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nIf you want to find emails on LinkedIn or Instagram, this tool works great. Although accuracy is not that best, it is still good and reliable enough when compared to other options in the market.\nThe Chrome Extension is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. Pricing is more competitive as it is on the more affordable side. It also generates more than one email which gives you more alternatives and information.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nMake sure that you keep track of your credits, as the credits don’t roll over if you do not use them. It does not provide live support, like chat or call. Customer service needs improvement in this case as the only way to reach them is by email and replies might take some time.\nData accuracy as well needs to improve, as there are comments from users regarding the inaccuracy of data as it gives them out-of-date emails or emails that don’t work anymore, although overall experience seems to be good.\nThere seems to be a lot of complaints regarding the free credits provided as insufficient as Kendo only provides 50 credits per month for its free plan version.\n\n## VoilaNorbert\n\n\n### General Features\n\nNorbert helps you find any corporate email addresses and manage your leads.

Accuracy may be this software’s strong point. You get quality.\nUsers also appreciated the organization of the searched list and the general ease of usage of the tool. The software requires very little setup and provides great value for the task it is designed for. The browser extension facilitates usage greatly.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nPricing. Not that it is the most expensive, but users have to pay extra for email verification and “enrichment”. These features are already incorporated in the pricing of other tools in the market.\nTypical of any email finders in the market, accuracy still needs improvement as sometimes email addresses found were obsolete. But still, this one is at par, if not above the accuracy rate of its competitors.\n\n## Finder.Expert\n\n\n### General Features\n\nFinder.Expert is a tool that finds emails of prospects and companies. It has a chrome extension for ease of use and access. Find only verified prospects by domain or using LinkedIn and Twitter data and you can keep contacts in one place.\nVerify and validate found contacts with our free verifier.

However, they don’t refund payment, in case of cancellations even when credits are still available.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nIf anything, you might like the fact that they use proofy.io to verify emails for free. It is a reliable app by itself, so expect to have some good, quality emails.\nPrice is also on the affordable side and the free credit they offer is insanely huge compare to most email finders out there!\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nI found out that its other name is Contact Finder (Source: G2.com). It seems that the chrome extension has only 3000+ users. No wonder, there are not many reviews and buzz of this tool on the internet.\nTheir webpage needs a revamp. It looks lazy and dry with not much “umpph” factor on it. It feels like it was not professionally done, as there are so many grammar and spelling errors that may reflect the kind of company and service they might offer.\nCapterra, the world’s leading software reviews and selection platform does not have a record of this tool on its website. This itself will give the customers an idea of how reliable Finder. Expert is.\n\n## FindEmails\n\n\n### General Features\n\nFindEmails.com (formerly Toofr) is email finding software that offers sales and marketing tools, email security and verification, and speedy processing, among other features.\nIt boasts of a 2-in-1 email finding verification service, which differentiates it from the other email finding tools, which treats each task as a separate step and separate pricing as well.\nEmails are then validated using FindEmails.com’s algorithms at a rate of 500 records per hour and with an accuracy of 98%.\nFindEmails.com provides you with a Chrome extension that you can use to identify potential email addresses without having to leave a webpage.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nFindEmails.com offers three different bundles of credits, which can be used for email searches, email tests, or other uses.\nAdditional credits can be purchased separately for  1 cent/credit with a subscription or for 5 cents/credit without a subscription.\nAll packages offer the same set of features.

It includes all features of the Essential plan plus Unlimited email validation.\nPremium plan is priced at $299 /month, including the same feature of the Standard Plan, plus 24/7 Priority Support.\nPlease note that the prices mentioned on their website are based on Singaporean dollars.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nPricing is its strongest sell-point. Unlike most email finders, EDT does not have a credit system. For S$9.99 per month, you will get unlimited searches and shell an extra S$5, and you will get unlimited email validation as well.\nThis is one of the most affordable among its competitors.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nThe Chrome Extension is temporarily depreciated with the latest major patch. You have to use the Web App instead with full functionality:  http://app.emaildiscoverytool.com\nIf you checked on their Chrome extension, there are only 85 users of this tool. The number might mean something for you as a new subscriber, as fewer users would also mean fewer reviews and in general, would mean how popular this tool is in the market.\nOn the website, https://www.saasworthy.com/, EDT got only a ranking of 73% SW score, which is below most of the other email finders.\nThey do not provide an API.\n\n## SellHack\n\n\n### General Features\n\nSellHack is a platform built for business owners and sales professionals to automate their prospect list building.\nIt is an easy-to-use sales prospecting tool that searches available public sources to find someone’s email address. With only the prospect’s name and company domain, SellHack delivers verified email addresses with high accuracy.SellHack also has a browser extension that helps you build targeted lists so you can send cold emails to your leads. You can uncover your sales prospect’s previously hidden email addresses while searching their social profiles.\nAccording to them, they have an industry-leading 12 step, real-time email verification engine that takes the guesswork out of finding the BEST email address for your prospect in just a few seconds.\nThe tool also has a bulk email verification option where you can easily upload your incomplete data files with ‘First Name’, ‘Last Name’ and ‘Company Name’ to find valid email addresses.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nWith SellHack, billing can be Monthly or Yearly. Pricing is also separated into 2 categories: INDIVIDUAL and TEAM.\nLet’s examine first the INDIVIDUAL pricing category. It has 4 plans available for its users.\nLite Plan, offers 100 credits and costs $5 a month with a basic plugin. A yearly subscription costs $3/month.\nBasic Plan, offers 350 credits and costs $19 a month with a basic plugin. A yearly subscription costs $15/month.\nStarter Plan, offers 1000 credits and costs $ 49 a month with an enhanced plugin. A yearly subscription costs $30/month.\nPro Plan, offers 2500 credits and costs $99 a month with an elite plugin, advanced list-builder full API access and Salesforce integration. A yearly subscription costs $60/month.\nIn TEAM category, subscription is either monthly or yearly and 4 options to choose from:\nTeam Starter is priced at $99 a month with 2500 credits with 5 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $60 per month (save $468).\nTeam Basic is priced at $249 a month with 5000 credits with 10 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $150 per month (save $1168).\nTeam Pro is priced at $499 a month with 10000 credits with 20 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $300 per month (save $2388).\nCustom, a Build-to-Suit program depending on customer needs.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nSellHack has a nice Chrome extension that stays on top so when I’m searching I can click on it from the pull-down and enter the data and copy/paste the results into my CRM.\nIt is so user-friendly and the interface is not too cluttered. Too often there are software programs that come as a service in there so jam-packed with materials that sometimes you can’t really make any sense of it.\nSellhack works best with LinkedIn. Sellhack deducts the credits only for verified emails. It has a Lead generating option with a beautiful dashboard.\nGenerally, it is less expensive than other similar software and they have good reviews on their customer services as well!\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nAlthough the algorithm is usually pretty accurate in terms of deliverable information, Sellhack is not 100% reliable. Emails offered can sometimes bounce back. In their Prospect List builder, you can only add a maximum number of prospects per day. For example, if you have the Basic plan, you can only add up to 200 prospects only in a given day. For inside sales- that deems an issue if you spend a day prospecting. There were some workarounds but were limited to LinkedIn policies- not SellHack.\nAs of now, SellHack provides only business emails. It doesn’t provide any phone numbers of the prospects.\nUsers can only have 10 free credits every month and for the paid subscriptions, unused credits will not roll over to the next month.\n\n## Anymail Finder\n\n\n### General Features\n\nAnymail finder started in 2015 when Thrust.io and Makesmail merged. It is an Email verification tool designed for businesses of all sizes such as recruitment agencies, lead generation companies, sales teams, email marketers, cold email experts and start-ups.The tool utilizes many approaches to find emails—it searches billions of web pages and performs direct server validation. Users can get emails directly and rapidly using their simple rest API.  You can search up by name, job title, domain or verify existing emails.\nAnymail Finder is a competitor to Hunter and Snov.io  and has one key advantage, it only charges for server verified emails. Pattern-matched emails are free.\nToday, thousands of companies use Anymail finder every day to successfully find emails.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nUsers can choose between 3 paid options or the free trial. There is no yearly billing, instead, users can  Buy a one-off or monthly billing method. All options have the same features.\n• Unlimited unverified emails\n• Only use for verified emails\n• Unused credits roll over when you subscribe\n• Use with all your team members\n$49/month, you will get 1000 verified email credits.\n$99/month, you will get 5000 verified email credits.\n$149/month, you will get 10000 verified email credits.\nThey also offer a free trial, in which you will get 90 credits which will not expire. It still has all the features of the paid subscriptions. You can also send their Support team a message, in case you want to have a CUSTOM plan.\n\nUsers can also buy credits without subscribing, however, credits you buy this way will expire in 1 month and will not rollover.\nAnymail Finder promises that emails which they can’t verify to be 100% real are free and credits will not be charged. Their pattern-guessed emails are 70% deliverable but they’re all free.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nTheir pricing model is very flexible and the features are great!  All emails that can’t be 100% verified are free even though they have an average delivery of 70%.\nWith a subscription, you can add UNLIMITED team members to any account. A feature not offered by most email finders out there!  Also, all your credits ROLLOVER so you don’t lose any.\nIf you only wanted to use us for one month, you can choose the ‘one-off’ for one month option and never worry about canceling subscriptions.\nMost reviews by users mentioned its easy-to-use interface. They also have an open API that we can use on our automation which is a great help. Overall, the software delivers what it promises, and is easily utilized.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nIt seems that their accuracy is not at par with its competitors, as they do “guess- emails” also. However, you will not spend credits for this.\n\n## Slik\n\n\n### General Features\n\nSlik Prospector is another tool that helps you to find anyone’s email. It is a highly targeted lead for your business and has more than 70 million prospects.\nYou can use their LinkedIn Chrome extension to prospect leads, save them to lists, and export them to your CRM.\nClaimed to be used by salespeople, marketers, recruiters, founders and hustlers at Slack, DocuSign, Workday, Okta, Dropbox and thousands of other companies.\nSlik offers an interesting proposition – your leads cost a flat 10 cents a piece. They also claimed to have 95%+ email accuracy, one of the highest in the industry.\nTheir chrome extension called Slik Prospector has over a thousand users as of writing.\nPerhaps the most unusual aspect of Slik is the fact that it was founded by a 14-year-old Canadian entrepreneur & whiz kid, Soroush Ghodsi, who is also its CEO.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nA free trial offers 20 credits and you can save leads to your list. There is no mention of a yearly billing, so all plans are on monthly basis only.\nStarter plan that costs $49 a month and 750 credits.\nPro plan that costs $99 a month and 2500 credits.\nA Custom plan, with customized credits and pricing. It promises to have up-to-date data and guaranteed deliverability.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nTheir promise of having 95%+ accuracy seems to have held.   As compared to the others, it has a high email accuracy on the market and offers all the real people, not to spam.\nOne of the most exciting and enjoyable things about this application is that it allows you to create the most targeted lists using its advanced filtering system. Slik Prospector also offers lots of key features such as automatically updating, fast working, and easy to understand UI.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nThere are issues regarding unsubscribing the plan. One user mentioned that he had difficulty in the process when he tried to unsubscribe.\nThe free trial credits are a bit low compared to some email finders. You might not be able to thoroughly “get the feel” of the application to actually move to paid subscription.\n\n## MailDB\n\n\n### General Features\n\nMailDB is an all-in-one platform that finds & verifies any email address on the web by simply searching a domain name. It includes features such as bulk email verification, catch-all server detection, disposable email detection, domain check, mail server validation, single email verification, and syntax check.\nThe software also offers features like Domain Search and  Personal Search. A Domain Search finds the contact details of professionals and email addresses for companies. Find contact information of persons using the Personal Search. The Verify tool will verify emails you send and prevent bounces. Essential for cold emailing.\nA cost-effective software that verified Bulk emails automatically. It also offers full API access to services.\nThey claimed to be trusted by 600+ professionals and used at these top companies: Adobe, GE, Indeed, Hilton. SAP, and Virgin America.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nThey offered a  Free version, however, there is no Free trial. All plans have full features and access that includes:\n• Domain search\n• Person search\n• Email verification\n• Bulk email verification\n• API access\nPricing is divided into 4 tiers.\nFree – 10 requests, No credit card required\nEntry – $9/mo, 1000 requests\nStartup – $19/mo, 5000 requests\nPro – $49/mo, 25000 requests\nEnterprise – $99/mo, 100000 requests\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nYou can add multiple, unlimited  users in your team to access your account no matter what tier/paid plan you purchased. Some of the competitors actually will charge you if you need to have multiple users in using their tool.\nAside from the email, Maildb will also include relevant information of your prospect, First name, last name, job title, and phone number included, automatically and FREE OF CHARGE!\nThe availability of their $9 plan is very much welcomed by the ead generation community especially for those who are just starting out in the lead gen business.\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\n(As of the moment there are no reviews that suggest improvement or needs development)\n\n## LeadCrawler\n\n\n### General Features\n\nWhenever you need only one “good” email address behind your target website or URL, LeadCrawler is a go-to tool.\nWith an intuitive interface, it’s quite easy to use. All you need to do is add your target URL to the search field and click “Submit.” In a few moments, there’ll appear the address available for your query. You can also upload a list of multiple URLs to speed things up and find emails in bulk.\n1/6 of all websites out there use Cloudflare, which keeps owners’ contact details obfuscated. Unlike many other tools, LeadCrawler can bypass security and find hidden addresses.\nSome people never ditch their personal emails tied to Yahoo, Gmail, and other freemails. They keep on using them for business purposes, that’s why this tool handles such cases too.\nIf the data is missing for the URL you submitted, LeadCrawler will check other pages on your target site and its official Facebook page. The social media lookup reportedly increases the number of successful email searches by 15%.\n\n### How much will it cost you?\n\nLeadCrawler has four pricing plans for any budget you may have.\nThe Starter plan costs $29 per month and provides 1,5K credits for 15K email requests.\nThe Standard plan costs $49 per month and comes with 5K credits for 50K requests.\nThe Professional plan costs $99 per month and offers 20K credits for 200K requests.\nThe Enterprise plan costs $299 per month and gives access to 100K credits for 1M requests.\nThere’s also a free plan allowing new users to test the tool’s main features. While it has 1K credits on board, email addresses revealed for free are partially obscured.\n\n### What makes you like it?\n\nAccording to their tests, LeadCrawler could find more emails than some other tools.\nAlso, they don’t store email addresses in their database, where they would get outdated. To provide you with timely and relevant data, the tool searches web pages for emails in real-time.\nWhenever LeadCrawler can’t find anything, it returns a contact page as an alternative. That way, you’ll be able to reach out to your prospect via a contact form. Quite handy!\n\n### What needs improvement?\n\nLeadCrawler is still on v1, so a lot more features could be added in the future if people need them (an API, email verification, etc.)\nWant to be added to this list? Click here to bring up our submission form.
