The technology has numerous practical uses. To get a clear understanding of the role AI plays in SEO and link creation, it’s enough to cast a look at its practical applications in these areas.\n\n## Implementations in SEO Domain\n\nHere are the most common uses the intelligent technology has found in search engine optimization methods, strategies, and processes.\n• Keyword Research\nAI tools and startup tools scrutinize volumes of data to pinpoint relevant and profitable keywords and phrases that are highly searched by users.
