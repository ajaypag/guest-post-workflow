target=\"_blank\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://hunter.io/\">Hunter</a></span></h2>\n<h3>General Features</h3>\n<p>With over 100 million emails indexed, it was claimed that Hunter is the most powerful email-finding tool ever created! It will find the email addresses of people either individually or in bulk. It is a Cloud-based email search solution that helps businesses find emails on company websites, verify domains, compose follow-ups, and more.</p>\n<p>Hunter Email Finder uses the most complete database of public email addresses to find the right contact information and everything goes to verification first before being returned to the searcher. Email addresses with a green shield passed its verification and so the searcher can use them safely.</p>\n<p>If the email addresses cannot be validated, Hunter will provide a confidence score on the returned email to help and guide the user on how sure and accurate the email address is.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linkio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hunter-homepage1622140884.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://www.linkio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hunter-homepage1622140884.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>How much will it cost you?</h3>\n<p>There is a&nbsp;<strong>free version</strong>&nbsp;of Hunter that gives its users 25 searches/month with limited access. The good thing about it is, a search is only counted if you get results. You will also get 50 verifications for free each month.</p>\n<p>The paid version has 4 tiers and will give users full access to the product. It can be billed either monthly or annually (with a 30% discount)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Starter</li>\n<li>Growth</li>\n<li>Pro</li>\n<li>Enterprise</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Starter&nbsp;</strong>Tier is priced at $49/mo if billed monthly and $34/mo if on yearly billing. This gives the customer 500 searches and 1000 verifications per month.</p>\n<p><strong>Growth&nbsp;</strong>Tier is priced at $99/mo on monthly billing and $69/mo if billed yearly. It provides the user with 2500 searches and 500 verifications per month.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro&nbsp;</strong>Tier will cost $199/mo if billed monthly and $139/mo for yearly billing. This will give the user 10000 searches and 20000 verifications each month.</p>\n<p><strong>Enterprise&nbsp;</strong>Tier is priced at $399/mo on monthly billing and $279/mo with yearly billing. It will also allow the customer to have 30000 searches and 60000 verifications per month.</p>\n<p>Unlike other products, there are no&nbsp;<em>Extended&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Plus&nbsp;</em>versions for each tier. You have to upgrade to the next tier if the need arises. It will cost you double the price but on the positive side, it will give you double the value of the searches and verifications.</p>\n<h3>What makes you like it?</h3>\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>free version&nbsp;</em>is really good! Many&nbsp;<strong>Hunter&nbsp;</strong>users have never really paid or upgraded to the paid version. The free searches and verifications are sufficient especially if you are not a heavy user of the email finder.</p>\n<p>The interface is very easy and simple to use even for a non-techy person. Of course, there are better ones in the market, but you will also have to shell out some dollars for that.</p>\n<p>The great thing about Hunter is that you can click the extension and it’ll even have their titles with their emails and phone number. Other products will charge you for the phone numbers separately (i.e SignalHire).</p>\n<p><strong>Hunter&nbsp;</strong>email verification does an excellent job of filtering out anything that is going to bounce. This greatly helps in protecting the integrity of the domain you are using in sending the emails from.</p>\n<p>You will Hunter easier to use with Gmail integrated features to keep everything synced and an amazing email campaign tool for <a href=\"https://www.sendx.io/resources/high-volume-email-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sending bulk emails</a>.</p>\n<h3>What needs improvement?</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the free version of Hunter works very well. In this sense, it can be prone to abuse in sending spam marketing and email communication.</p>\n<p>Another aspect is the pricing. There is no&nbsp;<strong><em>PLUS&nbsp;</em></strong>or expandable version for each price tier. If your need fluctuates, you have to cancel your current tier and buy the next tier or the lower tier. Also, the paid plan starts on a higher-end which makes it a pricey option if opting for the paid plan.</p>\n<p>Email verifications need improvement, based on user feedback. Sometimes it isn’t able to confirm the email verification or create false positives. So if you’re using it, be cautious and make sure to double-check the results before sending email to the recipients.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t work with Linkedin and other Social Media applications.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"rocketreach\"><a href=\"https://rocketreach.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://rocketreach.co/\">RocketReach</a></span></h2>\n<h3>General Features</h3>\n<p>For use in Sales, Marketing and Recruitment.

It already has LinkedIn and Gmail extensions and is also integrated into HubSpot and SalesForce. You can export files to CSV although you have limited API access.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong><em>Basic Version</em></strong>&nbsp;costs $49/month and $39 if you opted to be billed annually. This will give you all the perks of the Free Version plus other additional benefits like unlimited email sending and filters for easy search, and many more.</p>\n<p>It will also provide you with 200 monthly credits, whether you choose to have monthly or annual billing. The good thing is that new users will have a 14-day trial period (which most of the other email finders do not offer).</p>\n<p>The<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Professional Version</em></strong>&nbsp;will cost you $99/month which goes down to $79/month if you choose to be billed annually. There is no limit for email credits and will give you the extra benefit of being able to search for mobile numbers as well.</p>\n<p>The same with the Basic version, this also has a 14-day trial.<br>\nApollo also offers&nbsp;<strong><em>Custom Versions</em></strong>&nbsp;to its clients, depending on their needs.

Many users commented that their CS Support is great, replying immediately to queries while providing immediate resolution to customer difficulties!</p>\n<p>Their integration with LinkedIn, Hubspot and Salesforce draws most of their customers to subscribe to Apollo as it is very efficient, accurate and reliable.</p>\n<p>Another feature that you will like about Apollo is the 14-day trial period, in their paid versions. Most other email finders will offer you the trial period in their most basic or in their free-trial version which is very limited in benefits and access.</p>\n<h3>What needs improvement?</h3>\n<p>Just remember that Apollo charges you per user. So, say, your boss just wants to log in to view your activity or to check and track your progress, you have to purchase him a separate subscription.</p>\n<p>The tool can be quite slow at times when navigating from one window to another.&nbsp; Some of the contact numbers and even emails are not updated.</p>\n<p>While the general feedback is about great UI, the dashboard is quite intimidating especially for new users and beginners, with some commenting on higher learning curve in using the application.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"findthatemail\"><a href=\"https://findthat.email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://findthat.email/\">FindThatEmail</a></span></h2>\n<h3>General Features</h3>\n<p>It claimed to be the Yellow Pages of Email.

As the powers-that-be at Find That Email believes that users should be able to cancel their subscription whenever they want.<br>\nThere are 5 options for users to choose from:</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>FreeTrial</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Starter</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Pro</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Teams</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Custom</strong>.<br>\nCharges are the same across the board, however, the number of credits may vary, as clients can choose whether to buy the&nbsp;<strong><em>BUNDLE Plan, FIND Plans, OR VERIFY Plans</em></strong>. That’s right, they charge and allocate Find credits and Verify credits SEPARATELY.</p>\n<p>Let’s examine the&nbsp;<strong><em>Bundle Plan.<br>\n</em></strong><br>\nFor the&nbsp;<strong><em>Free Trial</em></strong><em>,</em>&nbsp;the user needs to sign up and will be given 100 Verify credits and 50 Find credits per month, with very limited access.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong><em>Starter</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>costs $29/month and will provide the user with 750 Verify Credits and 250 Find Credits.</p>\n<p>You can also use the application for Bulk Finding and will have Social Networks Support and Integrations. However, there is no API Access and credits are not transferable.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong><em>Pro</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is priced at $79/month with 5,000 Verify Credits and 1,000 Find Credits. It has all the perks of the Starter plan and the additional benefit of transferring credits as it will allow you to create 2 users.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Teams</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>will cost $149/month and will allow Unlimited users and transferable credits. Clients will enjoy 15,000 Verify Credits and 3,000 Find Credits while having all of the benefits including API Access.</p>\n<p>For the&nbsp;<strong><em>Custom</em></strong>, the cost will range from $249 to $2499 per month, with 25,000 Verify credits and 5,000 Find credits to 500,000 Verify credits and 100,000 Find credits per month, respectively.

Customer support is very fast, their email verification tool is very accurate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://findthat.email/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://findthat.email/\"><strong>Find That Email</strong></a>&nbsp;gives a confidence score and gives its users an idea if the email address is accurate and if it can impact their email bounce rate. A lot of the companies deduct credits for searching while Find That Email ONLY deducts a credit when an email address is found and that is cool! They also offer a 14 days money-back no-questions-asked guarantee to new subscribers.</p>\n<p>Customer support also is highly rated by the users, with a prompt response and easy to contact as primary reasons.</p>\n<h3>What needs improvement?</h3>\n<p>Some users’ experience searching using LinkedIn Chrome extension is very slow compared to other tools.&nbsp; Some competitors have a lower price per contact when compared. However, its high accuracy rate and overall efficiency compensate for it.</p>\n<p>The free trial doesn’t allow the user to try out all the options available within the paid plans. It would have been great if the free trial would grant this access so that new subscribers can actually “get the feel” of the application. As a would-be user, you would like to have a chance to test out all the features before you decide to upgrade your account to the paid version, right?</p>\n<h2><span id=\"leadgibbon\"><a href=\"https://www.leadgibbon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.leadgibbon.com/\">LeadGibbon</a></span></h2>\n<h3>General Features</h3>\n<p>LeadGibbon is a cloud-based software that generates reliable and verified contact information for businesses that aim to build and manage a B2B client database to generate sales leads.</p>\n<p>The software helps users build a robust contact list quickly with the LeadGibbon Google Chrome extension, which allows you to find the email address of any lead on LinkedIn Sales Navigator and export this data to the <a href=\"https://www.techimply.com/software/crm-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CRM software</a> you use.</p>\n<p>LeadGibbon gives you access to over 20 million contact records and over 1000+ companies.

It looks lazy and dry with not much “umpph” factor on it. It feels like it was not professionally done, as there are so many grammar and spelling errors that may reflect the kind of company and service they might offer.</p>\n<p>Capterra, the world’s leading software reviews and selection platform does not have a record of this tool on its website.

Pricing is also separated into 2 categories:&nbsp;<em>INDIVIDUAL&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>TEAM</em>.</p>\n<p>Let’s examine first the INDIVIDUAL pricing category. It has 4 plans available for its users.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lite Plan</em></strong>, offers 100 credits and costs $5 a month with a basic plugin. A yearly subscription costs $3/month.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Basic Plan</em></strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;offers 350 credits and costs $19 a month with a basic plugin. A yearly subscription costs $15/month.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Starter Plan</em></strong><em>,</em>&nbsp;offers 1000 credits and costs $ 49 a month with an enhanced plugin. A yearly subscription costs $30/month.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pro Plan</em></strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;offers 2500 credits and costs $99 a month with an elite plugin, advanced list-builder full API access and Salesforce integration. A yearly subscription costs $60/month.</p>\n<p>In TEAM category, subscription is either monthly or yearly and 4 options to choose from:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Team Starter</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>is priced at $99 a month with 2500 credits with 5 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $60 per month (save $468).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Team Basic&nbsp;</em></strong>is priced at $249 a month with 5000 credits with 10 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $150 per month (save $1168).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Team Pro</em></strong>&nbsp;is priced at $499 a month with 10000 credits with 20 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $300 per month (save $2388).</p>\n<p><strong>Custom</strong>, a Build-to-Suit program depending on customer needs.</p>\n<h3>What makes you like it?</h3>\n<p>SellHack has a nice Chrome extension that stays on top so when I’m searching I can click on it from the pull-down and enter the data and copy/paste the results into my CRM.</p>\n<p>It is so user-friendly and the interface is not too cluttered. Too often there are software programs that come as a service in there so jam-packed with materials that sometimes you can’t really make any sense of it.</p>\n<p>Sellhack works best with LinkedIn. Sellhack deducts the credits only for verified emails. It has a Lead generating option with a beautiful dashboard.<br>\nGenerally, it is less expensive than other similar software and they have good reviews on their customer services as well!</p>\n<h3>What needs improvement?</h3>\n<p>Although the algorithm is usually pretty accurate in terms of deliverable information, Sellhack is not 100% reliable. Emails offered can sometimes bounce back. In their Prospect List builder, you can only add a maximum number of prospects per day. For example, if you have the Basic plan, you can only add up to 200 prospects only in a given day. For inside sales- that deems an issue if you spend a day prospecting. There were some workarounds but were limited to LinkedIn policies- not SellHack.</p>\n<p>As of now, SellHack provides only business emails. It doesn’t provide any phone numbers of the prospects.</p>\n<p>Users can only have 10 free credits every month and for the paid subscriptions, unused credits will not roll over to the next month.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"anymail-finder\"><a href=\"https://anymailfinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://anymailfinder.com/\">Anymail Finder</a></span></h2>\n<h3>General Features</h3>\n<p>Anymail finder started in 2015 when Thrust.io and Makesmail merged.

There is no mention of a yearly billing, so all plans are on monthly basis only.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Starter plan</em></strong>&nbsp;that costs $49 a month and 750 credits.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pro plan</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>that costs $99 a month and 2500 credits.<br>\nA&nbsp;<strong><em>Custom plan,&nbsp;</em></strong>with customized credits and pricing. It promises to have up-to-date data and guaranteed deliverability.</p>\n<h3>What makes you like it?</h3>\n<p>Their promise of having 95%+ accuracy seems to have held. &nbsp; As compared to the others, it has a high email accuracy on the market and offers all the real people, not to spam.</p>\n<p>One of the most exciting and enjoyable things about this application is that it allows you to create the most targeted lists using its advanced filtering system. Slik Prospector also offers lots of key features such as automatically updating, fast working, and easy to understand UI.</p>\n<h3>What needs improvement?</h3>\n<p>There are issues regarding unsubscribing the plan. One user mentioned that he had difficulty in the process when he tried to unsubscribe.</p>\n<p>The free trial credits are a bit low compared to some email finders. You might not be able to thoroughly “get the feel” of the application to actually move to paid subscription.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"maildb\"><a href=\"https://maildb.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://maildb.io/\">MailDB</a></span></h2>\n<h3>General Features</h3>\n<p>MailDB is an all-in-one platform that finds &amp; verifies any email address on the web by simply searching a domain name.

All you need to do is add your target URL to the search field and click “Submit.” In a few moments, there’ll appear the address available for your query. You can also upload a list of multiple URLs to speed things up and find emails in bulk.</p>\n<p>1/6 of all websites out there use Cloudflare, which keeps owners’ contact details obfuscated. Unlike many other tools, LeadCrawler can bypass security and find hidden addresses.</p>\n<p>Some people never ditch their personal emails tied to Yahoo, Gmail, and other freemails. They keep on using them for business purposes, that’s why this tool handles such cases too.</p>\n<p>If the data is missing for the URL you submitted, LeadCrawler will check other pages on your target site and its official Facebook page. The social media lookup reportedly increases the number of successful email searches by 15%.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.linkio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/homepage-small1623810337.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://www.linkio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/homepage-small1623810337.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>How much will it cost you?</h3>\n<p>LeadCrawler has four pricing plans for any budget you may have.</p>\n<p>The Starter plan costs $29 per month and provides 1,5K credits for 15K email requests.<br>\nThe Standard plan costs $49 per month and comes with 5K credits for 50K requests.<br>\nThe Professional plan costs $99 per month and offers 20K credits for 200K requests.<br>\nThe Enterprise plan costs $299 per month and gives access to 100K credits for 1M requests.</p>\n<p>There’s also a free plan allowing new users to test the tool’s main features. While it has 1K credits on board, email addresses revealed for free are partially obscured.</p>\n<h3>What makes you like it?</h3>\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://leadcrawler.io/vs-hunter\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://leadcrawler.io/vs-hunter\">their tests</a>, LeadCrawler could find more emails than some other tools.</p>\n<p>Also, they don’t store email addresses in their database, where they would get outdated. To provide you with timely and relevant data, the tool searches web pages for emails in real-time.</p>\n<p>Whenever LeadCrawler can’t find anything, it returns a contact page as an alternative. That way, you’ll be able to reach out to your prospect via a contact form. Quite handy!</p>\n<h3>What needs improvement?</h3>\n<p>LeadCrawler is still on v1, so a lot more features could be added in the future if people need them (an API, email verification, etc.)</p>\n<p>Want to be added to this list?&nbsp;Click here&nbsp;to bring up our submission form.
