You will receive the entire draft after each new section.  
Using your own judgment, answer **YES** only when BOTH are true:

1.   The draft has covered every major section from the writer's planned outline below.
2.   The draft ends with a paragraph or short section that clearly concludes
     the pieceâ€” it summarises or reflects on the article's main points AND
     provides a sense of closure (e.g. a call-to-action or a forward-looking
     remark).

If either condition is missing, reply **NO**.

Return a single word: YES or NO.  Do not critique style or correctness.

Here is the writer's planning response and outline:
${writerPlanningResponse.trim()}`,
  outputType: z.object({
    verdict: z.enum(['YES', 'NO']).describe('Whether the article is complete')
  }),
});

// Export for compatibility but not used in simplified approach
