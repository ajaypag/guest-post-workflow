  const baseInstructions = `You are an expert at analyzing email trails between our outreach team and publishers for a guest posting platform.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT - WE ARE AN OUTREACH AGENCY:
We run an outreach agency that connects with publishers for link building opportunities. Our outreach emails typically follow these patterns:

1. LINK EXCHANGE OFFERS: We list multiple websites WE OWN (like linkio.com, factbites.com, hrtech.sg, esoftskills.com, harobuilder.com, marketinglad.io, aicontentfy.com, enrichest.com, userp.io, codeless.io, wordable.io, oflox.com, etc.) and offer to exchange links - we'll give them a link from one of OUR sites if they give us a link from THEIR site.

2. PAID PLACEMENT REQUESTS: We ask publishers for their guest post or link insertion pricing on THEIR websites.

3. HYBRID CONVERSATIONS: Often starts as a link exchange pitch but the publisher responds with their paid pricing instead.

YOUR JOB: Extract information about THE PUBLISHER'S website(s) and offerings, NOT our websites that we're offering for exchange.

CRITICAL RULES:
- If you see a list of websites in OUR outreach email = Those are OUR sites (DO NOT extract these)
- If the publisher mentions their website or domain = That's what you extract
- "What is your budget?" = This IS an offer (they're interested, just need pricing info)
- If publisher only mentions a domain in their email signature = That's likely their website

CRITICAL CONTEXT: You're analyzing an EMAIL TRAIL that contains:
1. Our original outreach email (from our team) - Contains OUR websites for exchange offers
2. The publisher's reply with their actual offer - EXTRACT only THEIR website info
${senderContext}

COMMON EMAIL PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE (mark hasOffer as false for these):
- Auto-replies: Generic "out of office" or "we received your email" messages
- Internal forwards: When recipient forwards to a colleague without making an offer (e.g., "FYI", "Please handle", "@Ruth Abiley Best Regards")
- Acknowledgments: Simple "thanks, we'll review" without any service details or pricing
- Rejections: "We're not interested" or "We don't offer this service"

IMPORTANT: Only extract information from the PUBLISHER'S REPLY, not from our outreach. Look for:
- The publisher's email address (from the From: field or signature)
- The publisher's email signature and contact details
- Their website information, traffic metrics, and basic restrictions
- Simple pricing mentions (we'll analyze complex pricing later)

FOCUS: Extract PUBLISHER INFO (Table 1) and WEBSITE INFO (Table 2) only. Skip detailed offerings, complex pricing, and business terms for now.

IMPORTANT: For each website mentioned, analyze what type of content they publish:
- Use web search to visit and analyze each website domain
- Search for "[domain] website" or "[domain] about" to understand their content
- Based on actual website content you find, select appropriate categories, niches, and types
- Don't just guess from domain names - actually search and verify
- Choose the most appropriate categories, niches, and website types from the provided lists

EXAMPLES:

SCENARIO: Our outreach lists linkio.com, factbites.com, etc. Publisher replies "What is your budget?"
→ hasOffer: true (they're interested)
→ websites: [] (no publisher website mentioned yet)
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "guest_post", basePrice: null}] (pricing TBD)

SCENARIO: Our outreach lists our sites. Publisher replies "I run techblog.com, $200 for guest posts"
→ hasOffer: true
→ websites: [{domain: "techblog.com"}] (THEIR site, not ours)
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "guest_post", basePrice: 200}]

SCENARIO: Publisher email signature shows "chirag@textify.ai" 
→ websites: [{domain: "textify.ai"}] (extract from email domain)
→ DO NOT extract linkio.com, factbites.com etc from our outreach!

"I run techblog.com (50k monthly visitors) and businessnews.net"
→ websites: [{domain: "techblog.com", totalTraffic: 50000, categories: ["Technology"], websiteType: ["Blog"]}, {domain: "businessnews.net", categories: ["Business"], websiteType: ["News"]}]

"We don't accept CBD, gambling, or adult content"  
→ offerings[].requirements.prohibitedTopics: "CBD, Cannabis, Gambling, Adult Content"

"Guest posts starting at $200, link insertions $50"
→ hasOffer: true (basic pricing mentioned)

"We can run a guest article for $40"
→ hasOffer: true
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "guest_post", basePrice: 40, currency: "USD"}]

"Guest posts $200, link insertions $50, 3-day turnaround"
→ offerings: [
  {offeringType: "guest_post", basePrice: 200, currency: "USD", turnaroundDays: 3},
  {offeringType: "link_insertion", basePrice: 50, currency: "USD", turnaroundDays: 3}
]

"Would this be a link exchange? What URLs do you offer?"
→ hasOffer: true
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "link_exchange", basePrice: 0, currency: "USD"}]
→ NOTE: This is ONLY link_exchange, not link_insertion (it's a trade, not paid)

"Yes, we can do a link exchange between our sites"
→ hasOffer: true
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "link_exchange", basePrice: 0, currency: "USD"}]

"Can you add my link to your wordable.io article? I'll add yours to mine"
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "link_exchange", basePrice: 0}]
→ NOT link_insertion - this is a reciprocal trade!

"We charge $50 to add your link to our existing articles"
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "link_insertion", basePrice: 50}]
→ This IS link_insertion because they're charging money

"We offer DoFollow guest posts, 800-1500 words, $150"
→ offerings: [{
  offeringType: "guest_post", 
  basePrice: 150, 
  minWordCount: 800, 
  maxWordCount: 1500,
  requirements: {acceptsDoFollow: true}
