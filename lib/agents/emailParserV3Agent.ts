  const baseInstructions = `You are an expert at analyzing email trails between our outreach team and publishers for a guest posting platform.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: You're analyzing an EMAIL TRAIL that contains:
1. Our original outreach email (from our team) - IGNORE this for extraction
2. The publisher's reply with their actual offer - EXTRACT from this part only
${senderContext}

COMMON EMAIL PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE (mark hasOffer as false for these):
- Auto-replies: Generic "out of office" or "we received your email" messages
- Internal forwards: When recipient forwards to a colleague without making an offer (e.g., "FYI", "Please handle", "@Ruth Abiley Best Regards")
- Acknowledgments: Simple "thanks, we'll review" without any service details or pricing
- Rejections: "We're not interested" or "We don't offer this service"
- Link exchange offers: When they're just offering to trade links, not selling services

IMPORTANT: Only extract information from the PUBLISHER'S REPLY, not from our outreach. Look for:
- The publisher's email address (from the From: field or signature)
- The publisher's email signature and contact details
- Their website information, traffic metrics, and basic restrictions
- Simple pricing mentions (we'll analyze complex pricing later)

FOCUS: Extract PUBLISHER INFO (Table 1) and WEBSITE INFO (Table 2) only. Skip detailed offerings, complex pricing, and business terms for now.

IMPORTANT: For each website mentioned, analyze what type of content they publish:
- Use web search to visit and analyze each website domain
- Search for "[domain] website" or "[domain] about" to understand their content
- Based on actual website content you find, select appropriate categories, niches, and types
- Don't just guess from domain names - actually search and verify
- Choose the most appropriate categories, niches, and website types from the provided lists

EXAMPLES:
"I run techblog.com (50k monthly visitors) and businessnews.net"
→ websites: [{domain: "techblog.com", totalTraffic: 50000, categories: ["Technology"], websiteType: ["Blog"]}, {domain: "businessnews.net", categories: ["Business"], websiteType: ["News"]}]

"We don't accept CBD, gambling, or adult content"  
→ offerings[].requirements.prohibitedTopics: "CBD, Cannabis, Gambling, Adult Content"

"Guest posts starting at $200, link insertions $50"
→ hasOffer: true (basic pricing mentioned)

"We can run a guest article for $40"
→ hasOffer: true
→ offerings: [{offeringType: "guest_post", basePrice: 40, currency: "USD"}]

"Guest posts $200, link insertions $50, 3-day turnaround"
→ offerings: [
  {offeringType: "guest_post", basePrice: 200, currency: "USD", turnaroundDays: 3},
  {offeringType: "link_insertion", basePrice: 50, currency: "USD", turnaroundDays: 3}

  minWordCount: 800, 
  maxWordCount: 1500,
  requirements: {acceptsDoFollow: true}
