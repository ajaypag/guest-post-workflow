## üõ°Ô∏è Security Testing Arsenal

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Payloads
```javascript
// Basic script injection
<script>alert("XSS")</script>

// Event handler injection  
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">

// JavaScript protocol
javascript:alert('XSS')

// Template injection
${alert('XSS')}
{{alert('XSS')}}

// SVG XSS
<svg onload="alert('XSS')">

// Filter bypass
<scr<script>ipt>alert('XSS')</scr</script>ipt>
```

### SQL Injection Payloads
```sql
-- Table dropping
'; DROP TABLE websites; --

-- Authentication bypass
' OR '1'='1

-- Data extraction  
' UNION SELECT * FROM users --

-- Data modification
'; UPDATE publishers SET email='hacked@evil.com'; --

-- Blind injection
' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users)='a

-- Time-based injection
'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'; --
```

### Domain Normalization Tests
```
example.com ‚Üí example.com
EXAMPLE.COM ‚Üí example.com
www.example.com ‚Üí example.com  
https://www.example.com/ ‚Üí example.com
example.com:443 ‚Üí example.com
```

## üèÜ Success Criteria

The publisher portal is considered **bulletproof for production** when:

1. **100% security tests pass** - Zero vulnerabilities found
2. **95%+ functionality tests pass** - All core features work under stress
3. **90%+ performance tests pass** - System performs under expected load
4. **All chaos tests complete** - System survives complete chaos scenarios
5. **All edge cases handled** - Graceful degradation for all failure modes

Only when the system survives this comprehensive chaos testing can we be confident it's ready for production deployment.
