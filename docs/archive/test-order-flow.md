# Order Confirmation Flow Test

## Test Steps

1. **Create a draft order**
   - Navigate to `/orders/new` or `/orders/[id]/edit`
   - Add clients and target pages
   - Set anchor texts

2. **Submit the order**
   - Click "Review & Submit Order" or "Continue to Site Selection"
   - Review order details in the confirmation modal
   - Click "Confirm Order"

3. **Verify the page transformation**
   - The page should stay on the same URL (`/orders/[id]/edit`)
   - The header should change to show "Order #[id]"
   - The main content should switch to the OrderProgressView component

4. **Check the OrderProgressView displays:**
   - Order status header with price and status badge
   - Progress steps visualization (5 steps)
   - Order details table with new columns:
     - Client / Target Page
     - Anchor Text
     - Guest Post Site (pending initially)
     - Draft URL (empty initially)
     - Published URL (empty initially)
     - Analysis button (empty initially)
     - Price
   - Account information section
   - Quick actions section (based on order state)

## Expected Behavior

- No redirect occurs after confirmation
- The URL remains `/orders/[id]/edit`
- The view transforms from edit mode to progress tracking mode
- All order details are preserved and displayed in the new format
- The progress steps show the current state of the order

## Implementation Details

- The `orderStatus` and `orderState` are tracked in component state
- The `isConfirmed` flag determines which view to render
- Account details are stored for display in the progress view
- The OrderProgressView component handles all confirmed order display logic
