# Order Edit Flow Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Field Name Mismatch in Order Save
**Problem**: The edit page was sending `subtotalRetail` and `totalRetail` but the API expected `subtotal` and `totalPrice`.

**Fix Applied in**: `/app/orders/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Before:
subtotalRetail: subtotal,
totalRetail: total,

// After:
subtotal: subtotal,
totalPrice: total,
```

### 2. Package Type and Price Not Persisting
**Problem**: `packageType` and `packagePrice` were being sent in the order group data but weren't being saved to or retrieved from the database.

**Fix Applied in**: `/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`

#### For Saving (PUT endpoint):
```typescript
// Now stores packageType and packagePrice in requirementOverrides JSON field
requirementOverrides: {
  ...(group.requirementOverrides || {}),
  packageType: group.packageType,
  packagePrice: group.packagePrice
}
```

#### For Retrieving (GET endpoint):
```typescript
// Extracts packageType and packagePrice when returning data
orderGroups: orderGroupsData.map(({ orderGroup, client }) => ({
  ...orderGroup,
  client,
  // Extract from requirementOverrides
  packageType: orderGroup.requirementOverrides?.packageType || 'better',
  packagePrice: orderGroup.requirementOverrides?.packagePrice || 0
}))
```

### 3. Order Detail Page Properly Displaying Groups
**Problem**: The order detail page wasn't showing the client grouping properly and was displaying $0.00 for all line items.

**Fix Applied in**: `/app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`
- Implemented proper client grouping with gray header rows
- Shows total price per client group instead of per line item
- Correctly extracts packageType and packagePrice from order groups

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Use the Test Page
Navigate to `/orders/[orderId]/test-edit` to run an automated test of the edit flow.

### Method 2: Manual Test
1. Go to an order detail page (e.g., `/orders/fc2acc67-17f7-442a-b20d-d4bfd2467f7b`)
2. Click "Edit Order"
3. Make changes to:
   - Line items (add/remove clients)
   - Package selections
   - Prices
4. Save the order
5. Return to the order detail page
6. Verify all changes are reflected correctly

## Database Schema Context

The `orderGroups` table uses a JSONB field `requirementOverrides` to store flexible data:
```sql
requirementOverrides: jsonb('requirement_overrides').default('{}')
```

This allows storing packageType, packagePrice, and other client-specific overrides without modifying the schema.

## What's Working Now

✅ Field names are correctly mapped between UI and API
✅ Package type and price selections are saved to the database
✅ Order detail page shows correct grouping and pricing
✅ Edit flow properly updates all order data
✅ Progressive disclosure works based on order state

## Potential Future Improvements

1. Add validation to ensure packageType is one of: 'good', 'better', 'best'
2. Add audit logging for order edits
3. Consider moving packageType and packagePrice to dedicated columns if they become core fields
4. Add optimistic updates to improve perceived performance
