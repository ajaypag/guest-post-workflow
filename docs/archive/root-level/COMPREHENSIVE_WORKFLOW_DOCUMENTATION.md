    }
  },
  "step1": {
    "outputs": {
      "keywords": "GPT output...",
      "csvExported": "completed",
      "urlSummaries": "URL analysis..."
    }
  }
  // ... continues for all 16 steps
}
```

  // Clear existing timeout
  if (typingTimeout) clearTimeout(typingTimeout);
  
  // Set new timeout for saving
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    setSaveStatus('saving');
    saveData(value).then(() => {
      setSaveStatus('saved');
    });
  }, 1000);
  
  setTypingTimeout(timeout);
};
