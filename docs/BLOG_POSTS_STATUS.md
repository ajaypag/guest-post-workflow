## Action Items

### Immediate Fix Applied
- ✅ Removed all 36 broken links from `/app/blog/page.tsx` to prevent 404 errors
- ✅ Blog page now only shows the 15 working posts

### Future Work Needed
1. **Option A:** Create actual page content for the 36 missing blog posts
   - Use BlogPostTemplate component
   - Write or generate actual content
   - Add proper metadata and SEO optimization

2. **Option B:** Permanently remove these topics from the content strategy
   - Already removed from blog listing
   - No further action needed

3. **Option C:** Create placeholder pages with "Coming Soon" message
   - Better user experience than 404
   - Shows content is planned
   - Can track interest via analytics

## Technical Notes

- All working blog posts use the `BlogPostTemplate` component
- Blog posts need a `page.tsx` file in `/app/[slug]/` directory
- Each post should have proper metadata for SEO
- Consider using a CMS or MDX for easier blog management in the future

## File Locations

- Blog listing: `/app/blog/page.tsx`
- Blog template: `/components/BlogPostTemplate.tsx`
- Individual posts: `/app/[post-slug]/page.tsx`
