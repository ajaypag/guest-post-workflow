# Homepage Consolidation Plan

## Executive Summary
Current homepage has **30-40% redundant content** spread across 10 sections. This plan outlines specific consolidation actions to create a tighter, more focused narrative while maintaining all core value propositions.

## Current Structure (10 Sections)
1. Hero
2. Problem 
3. Mechanism
4. Proof
5. How It Works
6. Why Now
7. Pricing
8. Demo
9. FAQ
10. Final CTA

## Proposed Structure (7 Sections)
1. Hero
2. Problem + Why Now (MERGED)
3. Solution (Replaces Mechanism + How It Works)
4. Proof
5. Pricing
6. FAQ
7. Demo + CTA (MERGED)

## PHASE 1: Merge Redundant Sections

### Action 1: Combine "Why Now" + "Final CTA" → Single Urgency Section
**Current Issues:**
- Exact same headline: "Every Day You Wait, Competitors Claim More Territory"
- 90% content overlap
- Same urgency messages repeated

**Proposed Solution:**
- DELETE Final CTA section entirely
- ENHANCE Why Now section with CTA button
- MOVE guarantee message to FAQ or Pricing

**Files to Edit:**
- Delete: `components/homepage/FinalCTASection.tsx`
- Edit: `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` (remove import and component)
- Edit: `components/homepage/WhyNowSection.tsx` (add CTA button at bottom)

### Action 2: Combine "Mechanism" + "How It Works" → Single "Solution" Section
**Current Issues:**
- Both explain the same process
- Mechanism has 3 steps, How It Works has 5 steps
- Overlapping explanations of site finding and content creation

**Proposed Solution:**
- CREATE new "Solution" section with ONE definitive process explanation
- Use 3-step high-level + expandable details if needed
- Remove redundant explanations

**Files to Edit:**
- Create: `components/homepage/SolutionSection.tsx`
- Delete: `components/homepage/MechanismSection.tsx`
- Delete: `components/homepage/HowItWorksSection.tsx`
- Edit: `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` (update imports)

**Specific Changes:**

## Implementation Order

### Step 1: Create Backup
- ✅ Already committed to git

### Step 2: Merge Sections (Biggest Impact)
1. Delete Final CTA section

3. Pricing - Simplify messaging
4. FAQ - Remove repetitive answers
5. Demo - Minimize to essentials

### Step 4: Global Find & Replace

2. Search for "approve" - reduce to 2-3 mentions
3. Search for "transparent" - reduce to 1-2 mentions

### Step 5: Final Polish
1. Ensure narrative flow
2. Check for any new redundancies

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
- Git commit hash for restore: `b0e1dfbe`
- Command: `git reset --hard b0e1dfbe`

### Testing Approach
1. Review each section after edit
2. Check mobile responsiveness
3. Verify all CTAs still work
4. A/B test if possible

## Do NOT Remove

These elements are critical and should remain:
1. Core positioning: "Future-looking link building on topic-relevant sites"
2. The 47% conversion improvement stat
3. Pricing transparency (Publisher cost + $100)
4. Zero-click/AI era context (but minimize)
5. Case study proof points
