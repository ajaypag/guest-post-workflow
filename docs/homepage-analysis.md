# Homepage Marketing Analysis

## Section-by-Section Takeaways

### 1. Problem Section
**Core Problem:** The content marketing playbook is broken
- 60% of searches end without clicks (zero-click)
- 88% of AI Overview queries are informational with 77% zero-click rate
- AI scrapes content 179x more than it sends traffic back
- OpenAI scrapes 179 pages for every 1 visitor it sends
- Bottom-funnel converts 47% better than top-funnel
- Bottom-funnel CPM is 35% higher (buyers pay more for purchase-ready audiences)

- **Key insight:** "There are probably just 10 prompt variations that actually matter for your business. Are you showing up in any of them?"

### 2. Mechanism Section
**Their Unique Approach:** Find sites where buyers are already looking
- Step 1: Find buyer searches (alternatives, best of, vs comparisons)
- Step 2: Map sites that rank for those searches

  - "[competitor] alternatives"
  - "best [category] software"
  - "[your brand] vs [competitor]"

### 3. Proof Section
