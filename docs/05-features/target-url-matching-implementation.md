# Target URL Matching Implementation Plan

## Overview
Enhance AI qualification to include intelligent target URL matching, solving the current random domain assignment problem. This adds a second AI step that determines which client target URL best matches each qualified domain.

## Current Problem
- Domains are randomly assigned to line items during "Add to Order" process
- No intelligence about which domain serves which target URL best
- Users have no visibility into why domains were chosen for specific target pages

## Solution
Two-step AI process:
1. **Step 1 (Existing):** Domain qualification - determines if domain is suitable
2. **Step 2 (New):** Target URL matching - determines which target URL each qualified domain best serves

## Database Changes

### Add Target Matching Fields to `bulk_analysis_domains`

```sql
-- Migration: Add target URL matching support
ALTER TABLE bulk_analysis_domains 
ADD COLUMN suggested_target_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN target_match_data JSONB,
ADD COLUMN target_matched_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Index for querying by suggested target URL
CREATE INDEX idx_bulk_domains_suggested_target 
ON bulk_analysis_domains(suggested_target_url);
```

### Field Descriptions
- `suggested_target_url`: AI's top pick for best matching target URL
- `target_match_data`: Full JSON analysis results from step 2 (all target URLs with scores)
- `target_matched_at`: When target matching was last performed

---

## AI Service Changes

### Extend AIQualificationService

```typescript
// Add new interfaces
interface TargetMatchResult {
  domainId: string;
  domain: string;
  target_analysis: Array<{
    target_url: string;
    overlap_status: 'direct' | 'related' | 'both' | 'none';
    strength_direct: 'strong' | 'moderate' | 'weak' | 'n/a';
    strength_related: 'strong' | 'moderate' | 'weak' | 'n/a';
    match_quality: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor';
    evidence: {
      direct_count: number;
      direct_median_position: number | null;
      direct_keywords: string[];
      related_count: number;
      related_median_position: number | null;
      related_keywords: string[];
    };
    reasoning: string;
  }>;
  best_target_url: string;
  recommendation_summary: string;
}

// Add new method to AIQualificationService
export class AIQualificationService {
  // Existing methods unchanged...
  
  /**
   * Step 2: Match qualified domains to target URLs
   */
  async matchTargetUrls(
    qualifiedDomains: Array<{domain: DomainData, qualification: QualificationResult}>,
    clientContext: ClientContext,
    onProgress?: (completed: number, total: number) => void
  ): Promise<TargetMatchResult[]>
  
  private async processTargetMatching(
    domain: DomainData, 
    context: ClientContext
  ): Promise<TargetMatchResult>
  
  private buildTargetMatchingPrompt(
    domain: DomainData, 
    context: ClientContext
  ): string
}
```

### AI Prompt for Target Matching

```typescript
private buildTargetMatchingPrompt(domain: DomainData, context: ClientContext): string {
  return `You will match a qualified guest post site to the best target URLs.

**Your Task:**
For EACH target URL, analyze the topical overlap and ranking strength.

**Analysis Framework:**

1. **Overlap Assessment per Target URL:**
   For each target URL, judge topical overlap between the site's rankings and that specific target URL's keywords:
   - *Direct* → Site already ranks for highly specific keywords that match this target URL's niche  
   - *Related* → Site ranks for obviously relevant sibling/broader industry topics to this target URL but not the highly specific ones
   - *Both* → Site has both direct and related keyword coverage for this target URL
   - *None* → No meaningful keyword alignment with this target URL

2. **Strength Assessment per Overlap Type:**
   *Strong* ≈ positions 1-30 (pages 1-3)  
   *Moderate* ≈ positions 31-60 (pages 4-6)  
   *Weak* ≈ positions 61-100 (pages 7-10)
   
3. **Match Quality Determination:**
   • **excellent** → Direct overlap AND Strong/Moderate strength
   • **good** → Direct overlap with Weak strength OR Related overlap with Strong/Moderate strength
   • **fair** → Related overlap with Weak strength OR mixed signals
   • **poor** → No meaningful overlap

4. **Evidence Collection:**
   Count matches and identify median positions for audit trail.

Client Target URLs to Match:
\${JSON.stringify(clientInfo, null, 2)}

Guest Post Site Rankings:
\${JSON.stringify(domainInfo, null, 2)}

OUTPUT — RETURN EXACTLY THIS JSON:
{
  "target_analysis": [
    {
      "target_url": "<URL>",
      "overlap_status": "direct" | "related" | "both" | "none",
      "strength_direct": "strong" | "moderate" | "weak" | "n/a",
      "strength_related": "strong" | "moderate" | "weak" | "n/a", 
      "match_quality": "excellent" | "good" | "fair" | "poor",
      "evidence": {
        "direct_count": <integer>,
        "direct_median_position": <integer or null>,
        "direct_keywords": ["keyword1 (pos #X)", "keyword2 (pos #Y)"],
        "related_count": <integer>,
        "related_median_position": <integer or null>,
        "related_keywords": ["keyword1 (pos #X)", "keyword2 (pos #Y)"]
      },
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of match quality and evidence"
    }
  ],
  "best_target_url": "<URL with highest match quality>",
  "recommendation_summary": "Overall strategy recommendation based on strongest matches"
}`;
}
```

## API Endpoints

### New Standalone Endpoint
**POST** `/api/clients/[id]/bulk-analysis/target-match`

```typescript
// For running target matching separately
export async function POST(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id: clientId } = await params;
  const { domainIds } = await request.json();

  // Get qualified domains only
  const domains = await getQualifiedDomains(clientId, domainIds);
  if (domains.length === 0) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'No qualified domains found' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Get client context
  const clientContext = await getClientContext(clientId);
  
  // Run target matching
  const aiService = new AIQualificationService();
  const targetMatches = await aiService.matchTargetUrls(domains, clientContext);
  
  // Update database
  await updateDomainsWithTargetMatches(targetMatches);
  
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, matches: targetMatches });
}
```

### Update Master Qualify Endpoint
**POST** `/api/clients/[id]/bulk-analysis/master-qualify`

```typescript
// Enhanced to include target matching
export async function POST(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  // ... existing DataForSEO and AI qualification logic ...
  
  // NEW: Add target matching for qualified domains
  const qualifiedDomains = qualifications.filter(q => 
    ['high_quality', 'good_quality'].includes(q.qualification)
  );

  let targetMatches: TargetMatchResult[] = [];
  if (qualifiedDomains.length > 0) {
    console.log(`🎯 Starting target URL matching for ${qualifiedDomains.length} qualified domains`);
    
    targetMatches = await aiService.matchTargetUrls(
      qualifiedDomains.map(q => ({ domain: findDomain(q.domainId), qualification: q })),
      clientContext,
      (completed, total) => {
        console.log(`🎯 Target matching progress: ${Math.round((completed / total) * 100)}%`);
      }
    );
    
    // Update domains with target matching data
    await updateDomainsWithTargetMatches(targetMatches);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    summary: {
      // ... existing summary ...
      targetMatchesGenerated: targetMatches.length
    }
  });
}
```
