## Critical Issues

### 1. Price Mismatches (99 websites - 10.5%)

Examples of serious mismatches:
- **realafrica.co.uk**: Website says $30, offering says $75 (150% higher!)
- **edtechrce.org**: Website says $45, offering says $120 (167% higher!)
- **disquantified.org**: Website says $40, offering says $90 (125% higher!)

**Impact**: Customers will be charged wrong amounts. Publisher expectations misaligned.

### 2. Missing Offerings (107 websites - 11.4%)

Websites with no publisher offerings at all:
- Cannot be included in orders
- No publisher to fulfill the work
- Pricing exists but unusable

**Examples**: truismfitness.com ($25), supermonitoring.com ($30), negup.com ($30)

### 3. Multiple Offerings Per Website (10+ websites)

Some websites have 2+ offerings from the same publisher:
- gossipsdiary.com: 2 offerings
- sampleboard.com: 2 offerings
- www.lilachbullock.com: 2 offerings

**Impact**: Confusion about which price to use

## Migration Requirements

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Fix Mismatched Prices (99 websites)**
   - Update publisher offerings to match guest_post_cost
   - OR update guest_post_cost to match offerings
   - Decision needed: Which is source of truth?

2. **Create Missing Offerings (107 websites)**
   - Generate publisher offerings for websites without them
   - Use guest_post_cost as base_price (converted to cents)

3. **Resolve Duplicate Offerings (10+ websites)**
   - Keep only one offering per website
   - Archive or delete duplicates

### Long-term Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Ensure 100% coverage
   - Every website with guest_post_cost gets a matching offering
   - Fix all mismatches

2. **Phase 2**: Switch dependency
   - Update all code to use publisher_offerings.base_price
   - Stop using websites.guest_post_cost for new orders

3. **Phase 3**: Deprecate guest_post_cost
   - Mark field as deprecated
   - Eventually remove from database

## SQL Queries for Fixes

### Find all mismatches:
```sql
SELECT w.domain, w.guest_post_cost, po.base_price/100.0 as offering_price
FROM websites w
JOIN publisher_websites pw ON pw.website_id = w.id
JOIN publisher_offerings po ON po.publisher_id = pw.publisher_id
WHERE w.guest_post_cost IS NOT NULL
  AND po.base_price != (w.guest_post_cost * 100)::INTEGER;
```

### Find websites without offerings:
```sql
SELECT w.domain, w.guest_post_cost
FROM websites w
LEFT JOIN publisher_websites pw ON pw.website_id = w.id
WHERE w.guest_post_cost IS NOT NULL
  AND pw.id IS NULL;
```

### Create missing offerings:
```sql
-- Would need to be done programmatically with proper publisher assignment
INSERT INTO publisher_offerings (publisher_id, offering_name, base_price, ...)
SELECT ...
```

## Conclusion

**78.1% match rate is good but not production-ready**. The 21.9% of mismatches and missing offerings represent potential order failures and incorrect pricing. This needs to be fixed before migrating away from guest_post_cost.
