# Order Interface Redesign Progress

**Status**: In Progress (2025-01-31)  
**Branch**: `buyer-portal`

## Overview

Major redesign of the three-column order creation interface at `/orders/new` to improve space efficiency, organization, and user experience.

## Current Progress

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Placeholder System**
   - Entering link counts auto-creates placeholder line items
   - Clicking targets fills placeholders first before creating new items
   - Default link count of 1 when selecting clients

2. **Dual Mode Interface**
   - **Simple Mode**: 3-step wizard for "figure it out for me" users
   - **Detailed Mode**: Full control with three-column layout
   - Toggle at top of interface

3. **Package/Pricing Selection**
   - Bronze ($75), Silver ($125), Gold ($200), Custom
   - In Simple Mode: Step 3 of wizard
   - In Detailed Mode: Bottom bar selection

4. **Space-Efficient Design (Initial Pass)**
   - **Left Sidebar**: Compact client cards with inline +/- link controls
   - **Middle Column**: Grouped by client with collapsible sections
   - **Right Sidebar**: Grouped by domain with aggregate stats
   - All columns now have rounded corners and shadows

5. **Smart Defaults**
   - Auto-select 1 link when checking a client
   - Smart distribution for bulk orders in Simple Mode
   - Placeholder indicators with âš¡ icon

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

The interface has been redesigned but user feedback indicates more work needed:
- "its a start in the genral direction" 
- Space usage is better but still not optimal
- Need further refinement of visual hierarchy

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

1. **Further Space Optimization**
   - Reduce padding/margins where possible
   - Explore denser table/grid layouts
   - Consider inline editing patterns

2. **Visual Hierarchy Improvements**
   - Better use of typography scales
   - Clearer primary/secondary actions
   - Improved focus states

3. **Functional Enhancements**
   - Make grouping dropdown functional (currently placeholder)
   - Add bulk actions for grouped items
   - Implement inline creation modals for clients/targets

4. **Performance**
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Optimistic updates for better responsiveness

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

```typescript
// Three main columns with new grouped layouts
<div className="flex-1 flex gap-4 p-4 overflow-hidden relative bg-gray-100">
  {/* Left: Client Selection */}
  {/* Middle: Grouped Line Items */}
  {/* Right: Domain-Grouped Targets */}
</div>
```

### State Management

```typescript
// Expansion state for groups
const [expandedClients, setExpandedClients] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [expandedDomains, setExpandedDomains] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

### Grouping Logic

```typescript
// Group line items by client
Object.entries(
  lineItems.reduce((acc, item) => {
    if (!acc[item.clientName]) acc[item.clientName] = [];
    acc[item.clientName].push(item);
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record<string, typeof lineItems>)
)

// Group targets by domain
Object.entries(
  getFilteredTargets().reduce((acc, target) => {
    if (!acc[target.domain]) acc[target.domain] = [];
    acc[target.domain].push(target);
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record<string, TargetPageWithMetadata[]>)
)
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Grouping by Default**: Reduces cognitive load by organizing related items
2. **Sticky Headers**: Keep context visible during scrolling
3. **Inline Controls**: Reduce clicks needed for common actions
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Collapse/expand for managing complexity

## Next Steps

1. Gather more specific user feedback on pain points
2. A/B test different density levels
3. Consider alternative layouts (e.g., master-detail, tabs)
4. Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
