# Payment System Enhancement Roadmap

Based on the comprehensive analysis, here's a prioritized roadmap for implementing advanced payment features.

## 🚨 **Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Security (Immediate - 1-2 weeks)**

### ✅ **Already Completed**
- ✅ Fixed Stripe API version
- ✅ Enhanced webhook security with rate limiting
- ✅ Improved error handling in UI components
- ✅ Environment validation system

### 🔧 **Immediate Actions Required**

1. **Deploy Enhanced Security Measures**
   - Implement `PaymentSecurity.validateWebhookWithTimestamp()` in webhook handler
   - Add adaptive rate limiting with progressive penalties
   - Deploy audit logging for all payment events

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Add Redis caching for payment intents (if Redis available)
   - Implement distributed locking for concurrent payment processing
   - Add database query optimization indexes

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up payment system health checks
   - Implement stuck payment recovery (run daily)
   - Add webhook retry mechanism for failed events

## 💰 **Phase 2: Advanced Payment Features (2-4 weeks)**

### **Credits & Wallet System**
```sql
-- New tables to add to your payment schema
CREATE TABLE account_credits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  account_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id),
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  currency VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD',
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  source VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  remaining_amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  is_fully_used BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  granted_by UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_account_credits_account ON account_credits(account_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_account_credits_expires ON account_credits(expires_at);
```
