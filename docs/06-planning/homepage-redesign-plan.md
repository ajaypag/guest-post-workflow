# Homepage Redesign Planning Document

## Core Philosophy
AI SEO is SEO - with a more focused, bottom-funnel obsessed twist. Top of funnel is dead. We're not dismissing AI traffic, we're being strategic about what actually matters.

## Inputs & Context

### 1. Marketing Gospel (7 Principles)
1. **People Buy Transformation**
   - Not features, not even benefits - the future version of themselves
   - Weight Watchers: fitting into that bikini
   - Cursor: building what you dream of
   - Stripe: scaling revenue without headaches

2. **Buyer Awareness Levels**
   - Unaware → Problem Aware → Solution Aware → Product Aware → Most Aware
   - Most TAM is unaware (80-90%)
   - Start with problem/solution aware (easier lift)
   - Meet people where they are, not where you wish they'd be

3. **Buyer Sophistication**
   - Level 1: First to market ("AI you can chat with")
   - Level 2: Competition enters (amplify claims)
   - Level 3: Unique mechanisms (constitutional AI)
   - Level 4: Mechanism escalation (real-time citations)
   - Level 5: Identity focus (for researchers who value accuracy)

4. **Enter Existing Conversation**
   - Don't create desire, tap into existing pain
   - Loom doesn't create desire for fewer meetings, they point to existing pain
   - Linear doesn't convince you Jira sucks, they lean into existing fantasy

5. **Proof > Promise**
   - Specificity, acknowledgment, credible sources
   - Radical candor, reasons why, technical jargon
   - Celebrity links, metaphors, testable proof
   - Trust is the real bottleneck

6. **The Big Four Emotions**
   - NEW: Revolutionary, breakthrough, disruptive
   - EASY: Automatic, push-button, set it and forget it
   - SAFE: Proven, trusted by X users
   - BIG: Huge outcome, reclaim your week

7. **Specificity Sells**
   - Vague claims feel like lies
   - Specific claims feel like facts
   - "50ms load time" > "faster"
   - "$640B processed with 7 lines of code" > "simple payments"

### 2. Industry Reality Check
- AI referral traffic ~1% (but growing)
- Bottom of funnel is what matters
- Top of funnel gets scraped without attribution
- ~10 prompt variations matter for most businesses
- Reputation management critical
- Need to own branded search prompts
- Grounding = citations from reliable sources

### 3. Linkio's Actual Value Proposition
- User presents target page (bottom-funnel page)
- System finds sites with good rankings for relevant keywords
- Creates bottom-funnel content featuring client as top choice
- Deep brand intelligence for comprehensive, not generic mentions
- Training both Google AND AI on what you do best
- Owning questions around brand search prompts

### 4. Current Homepage Analysis

**What's Working:**
- Unique mechanism (AI citation engineering)
- Some pain acknowledgment (traffic down)
- Visual hierarchy decent
- Interactive demo component

**What's Not Working:**
- Too long and complex
- No specific proof/numbers
- Missing emotional triggers (easy, safe)
- Vague promises everywhere
- Not entering existing conversation effectively
- Creating new desire vs tapping existing

## Key Insights to Build On

### The Real Conversation in Their Head
- "My competitors show up everywhere online"
- "I'm tired of creating content that doesn't convert"
- "SEO feels like a moving target"
- "Everyone's talking about AI but what actually works?"
- "I need to own my category"
- "Bottom-funnel queries are where the money is"

### The Transformation We're Selling
FROM: Invisible when buyers are researching solutions
TO: The obvious choice in every buying decision

FROM: Creating content that gets scraped
TO: Owning the comparisons that convert

FROM: Chasing vanity metrics (traffic, DR)
TO: Dominating purchase-intent searches

### Our Sophistication Level
We're at Level 3-4 (unique mechanism). Need to:
- Lead with mechanism (bottom-funnel placement strategy)
- But quickly move to identity (for B2B SaaS who get that distribution > creation)

## Messaging Directions to Explore

### Direction 1: "The Bottom-Funnel Play"
- Lead with the death of top-funnel
- Position as the smart SEO evolution
- "While everyone creates content that gets scraped..."

### Direction 2: "Own Your Category"
- Lead with competitive domination
- "Your competitors are everywhere. You're nowhere."
- Focus on the transformation of category ownership

### Direction 3: "AI SEO is SEO"
- Lead with cutting through the hype
- "Forget the AI hype. Here's what actually works."
- Position as the pragmatic approach

### Direction 4: "The Comparison Game"
- Lead with buyer behavior
- "They're comparing you right now. Are you there?"
- Focus on being present in buying decisions

## Proof Points We Need

### Specific Numbers Needed:
- How many comparisons/alternatives searches happen
- Conversion rate of bottom-funnel vs top-funnel
- Time to show up in comparisons
- Number of placements typically needed
- Actual client results with specifics

### Trust Builders Needed:
- Client logos or count
- Specific case studies
- Testable claims they can verify
- Reasons why this works
- Technical depth without jargon

### Option A: Problem-First
1. Hook with the problem they feel
2. Agitate with what's not working
3. Introduce our mechanism
4. Prove it works
5. Make it feel easy/safe
6. Clear CTA

### Option B: Transformation-First
1. Paint the "after" picture
2. Acknowledge current state
3. Bridge with our approach
4. Demonstrate the process
5. Prove with specifics
6. Invite to transform

### Option C: Mechanism-First

## Copy Concepts to Test

### Headlines:
- "Your competitors own every comparison search. Time to change that."
- "Bottom-funnel SEO. Because top-funnel is dead."
- "Show up where buyers actually make decisions"
- "AI SEO is just SEO with better targeting"
- "Own your category's buying searches in 90 days"

### Sub-headlines:
- "We place you on sites that already rank for buyer-intent keywords"
- "Strategic content placement where comparison happens"
- "Because 'best [category] software' matters more than '10 tips for...'"

### Value Props:
- Deep product intelligence, not generic mentions
- Sites that rank, not random high DR
- Bottom-funnel focus, not blog post spam
- Comparison content that converts

## Next Steps

   - Align all messaging to support chosen angle

2. **Gather Proof**

   - Calculate real numbers
   - Create comparison data

3. **Write Copy Variations**

   - Multiple proof point formats
   - Different awareness level approaches

4. **Design Considerations**
   - Shorter, punchier sections
   - More visual proof
   - Interactive elements that demonstrate value
   - Trust indicators throughout

5. **Test Framework**
   - A/B test headlines
   - Track engagement with different proof types
   - Measure conversion by traffic source

## Key Reminders

- Don't create desire, tap into existing frustration
- Specificity > impressive claims
- Meet them where they are (problem/solution aware)
- Proof at every step
- Make it feel NEW, EASY, SAFE, and BIG
- Enter the conversation already in their head
- The transformation matters more than the features
