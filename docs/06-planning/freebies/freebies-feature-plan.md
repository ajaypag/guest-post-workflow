# Freebies Feature - Collaborative Link Building Marketing Strategy

## Executive Summary
A marketing-integrated feature that offers free collaborative guest posting opportunities to drive signups and engagement. Users can contribute to listicle-style articles in exchange for backlinks, creating a win-win for both Linkio and potential customers.

## Core Concept

### The Pitch
"We're writing an article (e.g., '50 Best Tools to Grow Your Online Business') and publishing it on a high-quality site from our network. You can include your tool/brand for FREE - just sign up and submit your contribution."

### Value Proposition
- **For Users**: Free backlink opportunity without paying for guest posting
- **For Linkio**: 
  - Drive new signups (users must create account + client profile)
  - Demonstrate platform value before purchase
  - Build email list of engaged link-building prospects
  - Create collaborative content that's naturally diverse

## User Journey

### 5. Publication

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Considerations

#### New Tables Needed
```sql
-- Freebie opportunities
CREATE TABLE freebie_opportunities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  website_id UUID REFERENCES websites(id),
  article_title TEXT,
  article_topic TEXT,
  article_framework TEXT, -- listicle template
  max_spots INTEGER,
  deadline TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(50), -- draft, open, closed, published
  published_url TEXT,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User contributions
CREATE TABLE freebie_contributions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  opportunity_id UUID REFERENCES freebie_opportunities(id),
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  target_page_id UUID REFERENCES target_pages(id),
  brand_name TEXT,
  keyword TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  status VARCHAR(50), -- submitted, approved, rejected, published
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

#### Updates Needed
- Add SEO keywords to target_pages table (separate from prospecting keywords)
- Distinguish between prospecting keywords vs target keywords in the schema

### UI Components

#### 1. Internal Admin Interface
- Create/manage freebie opportunities
- Select website from database
- Define article framework
- Set deadlines and spot limits
- Review and approve contributions

#### 2. User-Facing Pages
- **/freebies** - List of available opportunities
- **/freebies/[id]** - Individual opportunity with contribution form
- Dashboard widget showing "Free Opportunities Available"

#### 3. Contribution Form
- Target page selector (from their existing target pages)
- Rich text editor for description
- AI assist button (generates based on target page + article topic)
- Preview of how it will look in article

## Article Framework Types

### Listicle Template
Most suitable for collaborative content:
- "X Best [Tools/Services/Resources] for [Goal]"
- "Top [Number] [Category] in [Year]"
- "Essential [Items] Every [Audience] Needs"

### Contribution Template
```
**[Brand Name]** - [Tagline/Brief Description]

[2-3 paragraph description covering:
- What the tool/service does
- Key benefits/features
- Why it's valuable for the article's audience]

Learn more at [Target URL with keyword anchor text]
```

## Success Metrics

- Contributions per opportunity
- Email list growth

### Secondary KPIs

- Quality of contributions
- User return rate for multiple freebies

## Email Marketing Integration

### Outreach Template
```
Subject: Free backlink opportunity - [Article Topic]

Hi [Name],

Found your site ranks well for [relevant keyword]. 

We're publishing a guest post about "[Article Title]" on [Website Domain] (DR [X], Traffic [Y]).

Want to include your [tool/service] for FREE? 

Just need 2-3 paragraphs about what makes it valuable.

[CTA Button: Claim Your Spot]

Limited to [X] contributors - deadline [Date].
```

### Follow-up Sequences
1. Reminder 3 days before deadline
2. "Last chance" 24 hours before
3. "Published!" notification with live link
4. "Next opportunity" for non-converters

## Risks & Mitigation

### Quality Control
- **Risk**: Low-quality contributions
- **Mitigation**: Approval process, AI assistance, clear guidelines

### Spam/Abuse
- **Risk**: Multiple accounts claiming spots
- **Mitigation**: One contribution per client/domain, manual review

### Capacity
- **Risk**: Too many/too few contributions
- **Mitigation**: Adjustable spot limits, waitlist system

## Open Questions

1. Should we limit to one contribution per user across all opportunities?
2. How do we handle competitor products in same listicle?
3. Should contributors reciprocate with a link back?
4. Do we reveal the publishing website upfront or after signup?
5. Should there be a "premium" tier for better placement in article?

## Next Steps

1. Validate concept with 5-10 potential users
2. Identify first batch of websites for opportunities
3. Create detailed technical specification
4. Design mockups for key interfaces
5. Plan migration for target_pages keywords update

## Notes from Discussion

- Focus on "barter post" strategy - value exchange
- Leverage existing list of 1000-2000 link swap contacts
- Keep contribution simple: name, keyword, description
- No images initially (too much work)
- Need to differentiate prospecting vs SEO keywords in target pages
- Consider making keywords editable by users
- Integration with existing orders/vetted sites infrastructure
