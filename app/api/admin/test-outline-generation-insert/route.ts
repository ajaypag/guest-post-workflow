      outlinePrompt: `Create a comprehensive research outline for an article about "The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Healthcare Systems". 

This outline should cover:
1. Current applications of AI in healthcare (diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery)
2. Benefits and challenges of AI adoption in medical settings
3. Ethical considerations and patient privacy concerns
4. Future trends and emerging technologies
5. Case studies of successful AI implementations

The target audience is healthcare professionals and technology decision-makers. The tone should be informative yet accessible, balancing technical accuracy with readability. Include relevant statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples where appropriate.`,
      
      clarificationQuestions: [
        "What specific healthcare domains should the article focus on (e.g., radiology, pathology, general practice)?",
        "Should the article include regulatory and compliance aspects of AI in healthcare?",
        "What geographic regions should be covered (US-focused, global perspective, specific countries)?",
        "How technical should the content be regarding AI algorithms and methodologies?",
        "Should cost-benefit analysis and ROI considerations be included?"
      ],
      
      clarificationAnswers: `1. Focus primarily on radiology, pathology, and diagnostic imaging as these have the most mature AI implementations.
2. Yes, include a section on regulatory frameworks including FDA approvals and HIPAA compliance.
3. Take a global perspective but emphasize US and EU markets with specific examples.
4. Keep technical details at a high level - explain concepts but avoid deep mathematical formulations.
5. Yes, include a dedicated section on economic impact and ROI metrics.`,
