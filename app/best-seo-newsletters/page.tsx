We sure did, and when we clicked through, each time we found an engaging text, sometimes only a couple paragraphs long, professionally put together in order to make the most impact on the reader. He doesn’t go in-depth into technical SEO, nor does he make guides and tutorials.
Instead, he shares wisdom and philosophy that you need to pay attention to if you seek to become an SEO guru yourself. And the best thing about it is the fact that it comes in every day.
