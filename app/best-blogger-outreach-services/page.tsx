        <h3>Outreach Labs Review:</h3>

        <p>Outreach Labs builds relationships that earn links. By doing focused outreach to corporate blogs, industry-known blogs or personal blogs, they’ve come up with unique processes and link building strategies that consistently deliver high end links at affordable prices.
They have a team of experienced link builders, project managers, and developers who are dedicated to providing the best possible service and experience.
Their main strategies include guest posting, ghost written posts, and link insertions. These strategies are beneficial in helping to increase traffic, build relationships, and improve domain authority.
If their first response is a price sheet, they’re simply not interested. This separates them from their competitors and allows them to offer ultra competitive rates. Try out their link building service today!</p>

        <h3 id="outreach-labs-response-speed-">Outreach Labs Response Speed:</h3>

        <p>We respond within 24 hours or you can easily schedule a free consult through our dashboard.</p>

        <h3 id="outreach-labs-link-building-tactics-">Outreach Labs Link Building Tactics:</h3>

        <p>Outreach Labs’ link building tactics are guest posting, ghostwritten posts, and link insertions. Overall, they stay away from strategies that rely on paying bloggers for links.
Instead, they focus on two things – building up a history of creating good content that bloggers covet and having bloggers owe them one.
These two factors combined are all that’s needed to generate great backlinks consistently.</p>

        <h3 id="outreach-labs-pricing-policy-">Outreach Labs Pricing Policy:</h3>

        <p>Their packages start at $1499. You choose a monthly budget and they build a range of links within that package. Each link is assigned a monetary value based on the DR, traffic and type of links it is. For example, if they score mostly high end links a particular month, the total links delivered will be less than if they’d scored mostly medium-authority links.</p>

        <h3 id="does-outreach-labs-do-real-blogger-outreach-">Does Outreach Labs Do Real Blogger Outreach?</h3>

        <p>They absolutely do! They target links from blogs with a content manager, content marketers, traffic-having niche sites, or in general, picky blogs.
Framed in another way, they do not believe links are valuable or worth building if they come from a blogger with a price sheet, a blog with no editor, an obvious link seller, a general blog with no traffic or a guest posts only blog.</p>

        <h2 id="2-linkbuilder-io">2. LinkBuilder.io</h2>

They strive to only earn links from real websites with strong organic traffic, who adhere to their own high quality editorial standards.</p>

        <h3 id="linkbuilder-io-pricing-policy-">LinkBuilder.io Pricing Policy:</h3>

        <p>Their monthly packages start at $5999 per month which includes a fully managed link building service and guarantees a number of links each month.
However, they also have a ‘Pay per link’ option which allows those with a lower budget to acquire links on an ad-hoc basis.
They also have minimum standards when it comes to the DR and traffic of a website they’re earning a link from.</p>

        <h3 id="does-linkbuilder-io-do-real-blogger-outreach-">Does LinkBuilder.io Do Real Blogger Outreach?</h3>

        <p>They do. They target blogs & websites that have strong editorial standards, and don’t shy away from attempting to earn placements and links on really high-end sites that are difficult to convince.
They share case studies on their website which also showcase some examples of the sites they’re able to land links on. From our analysis, those sites all looked to be very high quality.</p>

        <h3 id="linkbuilder-io-s-own-seo-">LinkBuilder.io’s Own SEO:</h3>

        <p>They have a DR score of 58 and over 8,000 organic visitors per month. Their website design is appealing and they frequently blog thought-leadership content around link building.</p>

        <h2 id="4-linkshero">4. Linkshero</h2>

        <h3>Linkshero Review:</h3>

        <p>The amount (and quality) of backlinks pointing to your site is a top factor for your website’s success. The problem is – white hat link building is always an ungrateful and daunting process because the conversion rates are so low.
Yes, there is A LOT of rejection.
In fact, for every 100 leads, you’d get approximately 3 links. The rest is a “no” and that hurts…
And this is when Linkshero comes in. Their experienced team, armed with the market’s best tools and a very large amount of “notgivingashit”, cuts right through it. Linkshero get the links you deserve.

        <h3 id="how-to-order-from-linkshero-">How to Order from Linkshero:</h3>

        <p>To order from Linkshero, you will first need to schedule a call with its founder or reach them on LinkedIn.</p>

        <h3 id="linkshero-response-speed-">Linkshero Response Speed:</h3>

        <p>They never added us on LinkedIn and scheduling a consultation without a real project to discuss is somewhat preposterous, so we’re not sure how much a link building campaign by Linkshero would cost you, but the owner is one of the better-known SEOs out there, and their service has tons of extremely positive reviews, so you can be confident Linkshero will deliver quality links for you.</p>

        <h3 id="linkshero-s-own-seo-">Linkshero ’s Own SEO:</h3>

        <p>The Linkshero website is simply the owner’s little presentation of themselves and what they do and only features a handful of pages, with only 13 DR and 29 monthly organic traffic.</p>

        <h3 id="internet-marketing-ninjas-link-building-tactics-">Internet Marketing Ninjas Link Building Tactics:</h3>

        <p>The method they use for content marketing and link building first involves creating trusted content as well as brand assets (infographics, polls, quizzes, videos, calculators, etc.). With Quiz Maker WordPress, you can create engaging and interactive quizzes that not only boost audience participation but also serve as valuable assets for content marketing and link-building strategies. Tools like Gizmo AI take this a step further by using artificial intelligence to generate personalized quizzes based on the topic you’re learning, making the process more efficient and tailored to individual needs.
Once they create awesome trusted content and brand assets for your site, they market this content, and in turn, you earn real citations (links), which increase your site’s trustworthiness in the eyes of Google.</p>

        <p>To place an order you have to go through submitting a contact form and discussing what exactly you are looking for with their VP of sales, but once that is done you get access to an extremely in-depth dashboard which you can use to track your project.
They even provided us with the login and password of a dummy account so we could see that dashboard for ourselves without ordering.</p>

        <h4>Heroic Search Pricing Policy:</h4>

        <h2 id="tips-when-hiring-a-blogger-outreach-agency">Tips When Hiring a Blogger Outreach Agency</h2>

        <h3>Should you outsource blogger outreach or do it inhouse?</h3>

        <p>Even the best blogger outreach agencies need time to succeed.
Outsourcing is not for you unless you can comfortably fund 6 months worth of activity.
If you have more time than budget, try learning how to build links instead.
You can eventually hire your own freelancers on Upwork and build tons of great links for less.
If you have the budget, outsourcing has its benefits as well.
Outreach companies already have processes and trained staff to act fast.
They’ve got established connections with top bloggers, making securing quality placements easier.</p>

        <h3 id="types-of-blogger-outreach-agencies">Types of blogger outreach agencies</h3>

        <p>I place agencies into 3 buckets: scammers, bulk, and personalizers.</p>

        <h4>1. Scammer outreach agencies</h4>

        <p>They promise blogger outreach campaigns but deliver private blog network or guest post farm links.
Tip offs:
• pricing below $100 per link
• sharing website lists with you,
• having fast turn around times on each link
These type of services no longer have a place in SEO in my opinion.</p>

        <h4>2. Bulk outreach agencies</h4>

        <p>It’s a numbers game for bulk outreach agencies.
Sending 1000’s of templated emails hoping for a decent response rate.
Success depends on how compelling the template is.
Offering $1000 for a link will get you responses for sure.
Pitching a generic guest post won’t.
Templates aren’t bad if the outreach agency knows what their doing.
A less personalized but killer value proposition template will drive plenty responses.
Good examples:
• Free access to a tool in exchange for a link
• High end link in exchange for a link
• Large social media visibility in exchange for a link
Bad examples:
• I would like to contribute a fresh, high-quality, article for your website at zero cost.
• I need a guest post on your website how much is your price for each post.
Not a fan of templates offering to pay for links.
Most responses come from worthless blogs because quality bloggers ignore such emails.
Ask your prospective agency about their templates to see how advanced they are (or aren’t).</p>

        <h4>3. Personalized Outreach Agencies</h4>

        <p>Personalized outreach agencies claim they personalize every step of their email outreach.
• Manually finding relevant bloggers.
• Manually finding the right contact person per website.
• Manually writing a unique outreach email.
• Following up across several channels like email, Linkedin, and Twitter.
Benefit include a higher response rates from high authority bloggers.
Downside is pricing. You’ll pay more per link as labor costs are higher.</p>

        <h3 id="do-blogger-outreach-companies-still-work-">Do blogger outreach companies still work?</h3>

        <p>Having success with blog outreach isn’t easy anymore.
Google is smarter. There’s more competition.
However, outsourcing your blogger outreach can still work depending on these factors:</p>

        <h4>1. State of your website</h4>

        <p>It work best on authoritative sites that are SEO-optimized.
The same campaign probably fails on lesser websites.
A good outreach agency discusses those factors with you beforehand.
Others will gloss over it, take your money and deliver links that’ll do nothing.</p>

        <h4>2. Backlink quality</h4>

        <p>What’s better?
• 10 links from niche relevant blogs OR 100 links from generalist blogs?
• 10 links from high traffic blogs or 100 links from low traffic blogs?
• 10 links from influential bloggers or 100 links from “admin”?
• 10 links that generate referral traffic or 100 links that generate none?
I can go on but you get the idea.
A real blogger outreach program delivers the former while most blog outreach services do the latter.</p>

        <h3 id="is-it-safe-to-use-a-blogger-outreach-service-">Is it safe to use a blogger outreach service?</h3>

        <p>Link building is dangerous.
A Google link penalty that sets your business back months is not a rare thing.
Year after year, Google updates are getting better at penalizing spammy links and aggressive anchor text.
Blogger outreach companies need to prove they deliver real links with proper strategy.
• Ask for case studies and link samples.
• Ask how they approach natural anchor text.
• Ask how they evaluate blogs.
• Ask about their buying backlinks policy.
• Ask how they evaluate backlink profiles.</p>

        <h3 id="how-much-do-blogger-outreach-agencies-cost-">How much do blogger outreach agencies cost?</h3>

        <p>Here’s a good framework for evaluating the monthly pricing of blogger outreach agencies.
Take their monthly fee and divide it by how many links they’ll deliver.
For example, if its $2000 a month for 10 links, then its $200 per link. $4000 for 10 links is $400.
Here are a few insights you can gleam now:</p>

        <h4>Below $100 per link</h4>

        <p>Probably means not links from genuine websites with traffic.
I’d guess they’re creating content for $10, paying a blog partner $15 to publish and pocketing the rest.
Meh.</p>

        <h4>$150-$250 per link</h4>

        <p>This is the realm of bulk outreach agencies.
They’ll send hundreds of emails knowing some genuine websites will respond.
Response rate depend on how good the value proposition is in the email template.</p>

        <h4>$300-$400 per link</h4>

        <p>Blogger outreach providers who promise real personalization come in at this price point.
If the company is charging this amount and not personalizing, you’re better off in the $150-$250 tier.</p>
