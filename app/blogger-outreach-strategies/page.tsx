            I've been a blogger for many years, and I get dozens of outreach emails every month. They're all focused on link building and ask me to link to their product, article, infographic, or services.

            Those folks don't even look up who I am and what I do. I've had several companies, including someone working for UpWork, ask that I link to their logo design services from my blog. I am a logo designer. I wouldn't advertise competitors even if they paid me to, that's just dumb. They don't even check who they're messaging.

            Their offers to share one of my posts on their social media in exchange for a link? Despite supposedly having 10+ thousand followers, their posts get less than 5 likes on average and zero comments. This means their followers are bots, not real people. Some value exchange they're offering.

            I know what they want, and I know why they want it. And because I know how valuable links from reputable domains are, I find outreach requests just laughable.

            Over time, we've noticed that people are usually quite unwilling to edit posts that are over a year in most typical markets, something like fashion for example. You're asking somebody to change something that really, they completely forgot they'd even written, so why would they care?

            But it depends on the market. We've worked with a client in the building trade, where regulations have changed, and it makes perfect sense for someone to update an old post that is essentially incorrect. For markets like that, we will reach out regardless of how long ago the post was made.

            It's hard to give a definitive answer. We try to keep it recent, but if the page we are targeting is ranking for its own terms and could potentially send us traffic, it doesn't matter how long ago it was posted. If it has been updated within the last 18-12 months, that's a good sign.

        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As a rule, the minimum threshold of domain authority to set is around 30 DR (by Ahrefs) or DA (by Moz). I guess it can work if you have a site with DR 30+ yourself.

          Bloggers you're gonna contact will probably follow the same logic – respond to people behind sites with DR 30+, as they are of "sufficient quality" to link to.

            If I were starting a business from scratch and were standing before the decision of which domains to pursue for links, I would first check competitors' backlink profiles. If they had no DA 30+ sites in their profile, then it might take DA 20-30 to beat them in SERPs. Also, it would probably save some budget and end up in better ROI. However, I would still target the highest DA first (maybe DA 25 in this case), as the impact would be probably the biggest.

            Let's say, on the other hand, that I have zero link-building budget, and the competitors have all DA 30+ backlinks. Then (speaking only about active link-building efforts), I do not think it might be worth investing the time in DA 0-10 sites to have low-value and potentially hurtful links. Maybe it would be worth building some brand awareness first (for example, via PPC or social media) to naturally attract high-quality links afterward. The only instance where I would still aim for DA 0-10 links would be if my site has not yet been discovered and indexed by Google.

            As for DA 10-20 domains, I think they are still useful when the content is very relevant to your niche. In the end, DA is just a metric developed by third-party tools, such as MOZ or Ahrefs, and their algorithms can always change. In general, I would always check DA in connection to other metrics and decide accordingly. For example, if the site is highly relevant, then I would allow a wider range for the DA. If the site is a generic news site with DA 30+, I would still go for it even though the connection to the niche is insignificant.

            If I were a recipient, DR/DA would also influence my decision. In general, it would depend on a few factors and, as a site that provides backlinks, I would need to see a business value in linking back to the pitch sender.

            First of all, the decision would be dependent on the topic relevance. For example, if I had a blog about dogs, I would be more likely to link to a pet shop. Then, the DA would not need to be exceptionally high to make me want to link back.

            Let's assume my site has DA 30+ and I get contacted by a DA 10+ site. Let's also assume that the main topic of both sites is similar. In this case, I will be happy to link back, as I might also benefit from the connection in Google's eyes. Also, I might be willing to negotiate about the deal in terms of the budget or other ways to support my linking site.

            On the other hand, let's assume that the pitch sender has a site DA 0-10. In that case, I would be asking for a premium value back, as I am risking being connected with a low-value site and potentially hurting my search performance. I would still consider linking back, however the budget would need to be agreed on accordingly.

            It would also depend on the overall strategy. If I had a full-scale private blog network, I might be willing to take more risks, as I could always adjust the link juice flow and potentially start new blogs. If I had only one main site that I operate, I would be much more careful with linking back to low-value domains, as my business is dependent on having a stable organic performance.

            But in general, I would suggest checking the pitch sender in more detail instead of following the Domain Authority only. It can be determined only after a detailed analysis whether the site is a genuine startup that wants to build a long-term value or a scam site with an unlimited budget that only aims for short-term gains. I would always suggest linking back only to the former example 🙂

            So, the reason people try to "warm you up" before asking for something that benefits them is that friends are more likely to do each other favors than strangers. I give links to my friends quite often.

            The problem is, artificially creating the perception of friendship has the reverse effect. Leaving aside any moral quandaries I may have with using humans like chess pieces in the pursuit of a backlink, it's also just ineffective.

            Layer one, if I don't know what someone wants after the first email, it's a waste of both of our time (thus, my advice to stop beating around the bush).

            Layer two, if I sense I'm being "tricked" through clever flattery or tactics, I'm likely to be annoyed rather than charmed. People are smart, and most can see through the gimmicks. You can still compliment someone's work or whatever, but if you're asking for a backlink, just put your request on the table and don't act like a weirdo.

          <strong>My two cents.</strong> If you decide to warm someone up with likes or shares, you can't just stop once you get a link. It'll make your true intentions way too obvious.

            Personally, I believe that now there's more to warming up on social than resharing or liking someone's posts. It's about building your network, making business connections.

            People are on LinkedIn to learn and to connect, and if you're there interacting with people and developing a network of connections who recognize your name, you will naturally be warming people up for direct outreach.

            When the focus is on building relationships with relevant people in your industry, this works. If you're doing it simply for the sake of later asking for a backlink, it will come off as spammy. And in my experience, having valuable relationships is always worth the time.

            Basically, if it's a detail that they've shared publicly, and it's something that was upfront (not something you've had to go back 3 years and zoom into a photo for), I think it's fair enough to mention it."
