        For example, Matt Cutts, a popular figure in the digital marketing and (SEO) search engine optimization spheres, secured the Add Me on Google feature and created a Google People Card.

        Like most search results, his search Google card helps you (or anyone) learn information about him. Here, you can see core details like his existing website and a brief description. From his people card, you can also reach his social media links — links to his accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram.

          <li><strong>Improve online reputation</strong> – Manually edit your public search information to remove any negative or unwanted associations.</li>
          <li><strong>Gain a competitive advantage</strong> – Feature statistics, facts, and images that reflect professionalism.</li>

        The Add Me to Search feature can work in your favor if you have an optimized Google People Card. Remember, your Google people search card is your public search profile on Google.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Don't be satisfied with generic info on your Google People Card. Edit it to elicit positive responses from searchers.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Think of it as a virtual business card or virtual visitation card. It helps you stay relevant through the changing times. It's also a way to uplevel your digital marketing skills and future-proof your online presence.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        To create a people card on Google search, you need a personal Google account, mobile device, and internet browser with a decent connection.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can create a people card:
      </p>

      <div className="space-y-8 mb-8">
        <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Step #1 – Type <em>Add Me to Search</em> on the Google search app</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Are you using Google Chrome? Then, type the keyphrase on the search option. The keyphrase <em>Add Me to Google</em> works, too. You can also search for a name.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Once you hit <em>Enter</em>, the top of the search results will display an option where Google lets you add this person to its search database.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Step #2 – Click <em>Get Started</em></h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Before you start, turn on <em>Web & App Activity</em>. If this feature is on, Google monitors and saves all your searches. You can say the same for every action you take using Google's services — location, IP address, device, and more.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">To turn it on, log in to your Google Admin console. Then, follow these steps:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-700 text-sm">
            <li>Find and open <em>Menu Apps</em>.</li>
            <li>Scroll to the <em>Web & App Activity</em> section.</li>
            <li>Launch <em>Service</em> status.</li>
            <li>Turn on.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Step #3 – Fill out the required information</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Fortunately, Google has no rigid content guidelines on this. But, to maximize the positive impact of the search card, submit content of the best quality and refer to Google's best practices for crafting content.
          </p>
          
          <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For most fields, you can enter the required information manually. As for the information about your email address and phone number, Google handles them. Its basis is the information you provided on your account settings.

            Check how your Google People Card appears to the public. Search for yourself and look at the search results. Focus on the quality of your information. Remember, it reflects a personal brand. It can also reveal if you have a weak or strong online presence.

            <ul className="space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
              <li><strong>No advertisements</strong> – Be straightforward. Don't use your Google card as a platform for advertising. Avoid using "top-class," "affordable," and other advertising words.</li>
              <li><strong>Add a photo</strong> – Post a high-quality and recognizable avatar or photo of yourself. Because you don't need to upload a cover photo for your Google People Card, ensure that your avatar reflects personal branding.</li>
              <li><strong>Select information</strong> – Prioritize essential information about yourself or personal branding. Better yet, choose the details you share publicly and see if they can help you achieve your goal better.</li>

              <li><strong>Avoid vulgarity</strong> – Use positive words to get on Google's good side. Google doesn't support hate and dislikes corrupt and unlawful behavior.</li>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The details you add to your Google People Card should reflect your personal branding. And adding more relevant info results in a more effective search card. Ideally, include your name, contact info, and links to your social media profiles.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I Create a Google People Card Immediately?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Yes. But, before a Google People Card shows up on the search engine's database, the team at Google will evaluate it first. If it passes the evaluation, Google will approve it.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I Edit Anyone's Google Virtual Business Card?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            No. You need access to the Google account that you used to create a Google search card. You can only edit a Google card that you created.

        <div className="bg-purple-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is a Personal Google Account Necessary to Use Add Me to Search?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Yes. It's necessary because it's where Google gets information to fill out for your email address and phone numbers. You can use your existing account or create a new Google account.

        <div className="bg-red-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Why Is Add Me to Search Not Working?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Not using a mobile device or mobile browser is a common reason the Google Add Me to Search option isn't working. Other reasons include not turning on <em>Web & App Activity</em> and not choosing English or Hindi as your language.

        <div className="bg-orange-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Add Me to Search Available for All?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Unfortunately, not everybody can use Add Me to Search and Google People Cards with ease. These Google features are exclusive to people in India, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. Google also had no prior announcements of its plans to make these features available to everyone.

        <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How Can I Make Add Me to Search Available in My Location?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            A workaround is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to create your search Google Card. Then, set your location to India, Kenya, Nigeria, or South Africa. Even if you search for how to create a Google People Card elsewhere, you still can't create a search card in an unlisted location.
