        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          With new google algorithms being rolled out constantly, many people wonder whether link disavows are good or bad for their sites when it comes to their rankings in the search engines.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          We all know that a bad backlink can harm a website, but is a link disavow the answer? In this post, we'll discuss exactly what a link disavow is, and how choosing to disavow links could be the only way to save your website from itself.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What Is A Disavow List?</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          A disavow list is a list of backlinks to your site that are deemed dangerous, spammy and not worth keeping as part of your link profile.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These lists are often generated using a professional disavow tool, and that your disavow file is then submitted to Google Search Console through Google's disavow tool in order to be removed from your link profile.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          These disavow lists often content unnatural links from spam sites, spammy backlinks pointing to your site that are auto-generated, and any other type of potentially toxic backlinks.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Are Link Disavows Good or Bad?</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Link disavows are seen as being a great way to disavow backlinks and clean up your profile, and remove all potentially dangerous or spammy links from spammy pages that may have had you in a penalty in the past.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These services are known to have many benefits if carried out properly, from ensuring your backlinks are safe, eliminating and removing risky links from your profile, helping to lift you out of Google penalties from recent algorithm updates and potentially improving rankings.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          So in general, link disavows are definitely a great service to have done, so long as your disavow is carried out by an experienced professional.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How often should you disavow links?</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As a general rule of thumb, it's advised you look at removing your spam links every year or so to ensure any bad links are removed entirely.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Ignoring spammy links pointing to your site over an extended period of time can lead to an increased chance of landing in a Google penalty, and more times than not, people are surprised at just how many questionable links pointing back to your site you end up with from past link building campaigns.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          Most sites nowadays will have bad backlinks that the owners simply aren't aware of, which could be identified and dealt with by a professional backlink audit company.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Examples of links that should be disavowed</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          There are many examples of links that should be disavowed from any link profile, including:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Private Blogging Networks (PBNs)</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Private Blog Network links, or PBNs for short, can be amongst the more spammy links in your profile, and if identified by Google, can be a big factor as to why you're not raking online for your chosen keywords.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Unnatural links such as these can sometimes be picked up by Google employees themselves, landing you in a penalty can effect you site wide.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          That's why it's important to act on any bad links as soon as you can, as sometimes you may not even know that a PBN link is pointing back to you until it pops up in a disavow tool.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Low-quality directories</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These low quality links can appear harmless, but a good disavow tool such a link research tools will quickly identify which of these directories are simply bad backlinks, and help you to move them into your disavow file.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Most sites will have some directories pointing to them in some capacity as part of a natural link building campaign, however, some of these can be extremely low quality links, and possibly worth removing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When used properly, a good disavow tool will be able to locate any bad backlinks, including low quality directories, and help determine which need to be added to the disavow file.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Comment and forum spam</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These spammy links often clog up a link profile contribute to the number of unnatural links pointing back to your site.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Disavowing links such as these is a great way to quickly clean up your entire link profile, as adding low quality links to a disavow file and removing them through google's disavow tool will help.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Again, a disavow tool will help identify these better than any, and provide you with the option of removing them.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Negative SEO</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Negative SEO attacks are a serious problem for many site owners, particularly in more difficult industries.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This manipulative link building technique is essentially carried out by a competitor that purposefully builds bad links to your site in order to negatively effect your rankings.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But don't worry, these spammy links, often from spam sites in general, can be identified through a good disavow tool, and then removed through google's disavow tool.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You'd be surprised how many of these links can end up as part of your disavow file..
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Paid Links</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Paid links are backlinks that have been paid for by the website owner. Now with paid links, it's not necessarily the case that all paid links are bad links, however often times, within your paid links there are some that are worth submitting to Google's disavow tool in google search console.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This link building technique often returns a bit of a mixed bag of quality, so they're certainly worth looking at.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Any unnatural links, spam links or low quality links often raise a bit of a red flag. A link disavow specialist will be able to use a disavow tool to identify which are worth adding to the disavow file, and removing through Google's disavow tool.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Hacked sites</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Hacked sites are never good for any backlink profile, and often fall into the category of link spam with irrelevant anchor texts and high toxicity scores.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Link schemes like these can often fall under the same umbrella as negative SEO, but sometimes, site owners will buy links pointing to their site, without knowing they're hacked.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          These unnatural links are yet another example of why individuals look to disavow backlinks, as this link building method can seriously pull your entire site down as part of the updates in google's algorithms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What We Learned from Creating 120 Disavow Files in 2022?</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Our team created 120 disavows files across 2022, and our findings might surprise you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The biggest takeaway from our testing was that so many businesses and website owners out there, no matter how big or small, are wasting money on poor quality, spammy and dangerous backlinks that point back to their site.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Each and every time we'd carry out a disavow, no matter how many times we'd convince ourselves that "this site can't have spammy links", lo and behold we'd see another batch of bad links that was dragging the entire site down.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          The key here is that so many are buying links without taking into account toxicity levels, anchor text diversity, trust and so many other factors that determine the quality of a link, scary really!
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Who Has the Best Link Audit Service?</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">

          They then provide you with an accurate and reliable disavow file for you to submit to Google's disavow tool in google search console.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Better yet, they even describe why they wouldn't recommend that link to begin with, as well as pointing you in the right direction for a link rejuvenation package post audit, too.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          So it's no surprise to see why Backlink Doctor are so fondly thought of within the industry, with so many loving the reliability of the disavow file they send them, their communication and services in general.

          Whilst it's always great practice to have link audits carried out to identify bad links, it can sometimes seem confusing what the best action to take is after you disavow links.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          Some people actually develop a bit of a fear of link building after an audit is done, but in actual fact, building high quality links after you disavow links is one of the best things you can do.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">FAQs</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Many Links Should I Disavow?</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          There is no set number to how many site links you should disavow as part of a link disavow file.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Instead, the best thing to do is to analyse the data that a disavow tool returns, in order to determine which links need disavowing.
