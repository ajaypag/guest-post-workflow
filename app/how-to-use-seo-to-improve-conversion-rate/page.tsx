            <h3 id="understand-keywords" className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Understand Keywords</h3>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              A keyword is a word or phrase people use to search for information relevant to a specific topic or industry. Since search engines prioritize websites that use relevant and popular keywords, you should collect the ones with high search volume.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Other than the search volume, here are the characteristics of keywords with high conversion potential. All keywords in the examples are relevant to an online retail shop.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-6">
              <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4">
                <h4 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">1.1 Intent</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  These keywords demonstrate a specific need or desire, indicating a readiness to engage in a transaction. It often includes action-oriented words like buy, purchase, or order.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  You can also create a sense of urgency by adding time-related words such as today only, hurry, and don't miss out. The screenshot below sets a good example. It incorporates the words quick buy to trigger prospective customers to click immediately. It also provides urgency-driven offers (discounts) for its best-selling items.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4">
                <h4 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">1.2 Long-Tail Keywords</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  Short-form keywords can help you reach a broader audience. However, if you want to target a more specific and motivated audience, it's best to use long-tail keywords.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  For instance, let's say your online shop is promoting Halloween costumes. Short-form keywords like "Halloween costumes" attract many searchers, which includes those looking for costume ideas, history, or decorations. However, incorporating long-tail keywords will narrow your target audience to those explicitly seeking Halloween costumes.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  These keywords typically contain 3 or more words in length. They also have lower search volumes but higher relevance and conversion potential. Here are a few examples of long-tail keywords for Halloween costumes:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">

            <h3 id="keyword-research" className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Conduct Thorough Keyword Research</h3>

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Potential customers are researching general information about HVAC systems or common HVAC problems. The HVAC company can create blog posts, videos, or social media content that provide educational resources. The ultimate guide to understanding HVAC systems or Top 10 energy-saving Tips for your home are a few topics you can discuss. These pieces of content help establish the company's expertise and build brand awareness.

              <div className="bg-red-50 rounded-lg p-4">

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Prospective customers are actively evaluating their options on which HVAC companies to get. The company can create comparison guides or case studies highlighting its unique selling propositions, such as advanced dosing system. This system helps ensure precision in product dispensing, adding value to the overall offering. Leveraging customer testimonials can further showcase the reliability and effectiveness of these dosing systems, reinforcing the company's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.

                  Turning organic traffic into customers – your website visitor is ready to decide which HVAC company to get. The company can create content that focuses on its specific offers. Service packages, financing options, and warranty details to name a few.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-6">
              Remember to optimize them for search engines to increase organic website traffic. You can focus on the following aspects:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
              <li>Compelling headlines</li>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Customer retention is also a big part of the customer journey. It allows business owners to maintain a positive relationship and encourage repeat business. Let's consider a scenario where a cleaning company wants to offer online courses for new entrepreneurs.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              First, they need to build a solid community. When individuals feel connected to a brand and its community, they are more likely to engage and become brand advocates. Once they do, they can offer online resources and courses to help new entrepreneurs start their own cleaning businesses.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              They can also share a comprehensive guide to help new entrepreneurs pick an outstanding cleaning business name or set the right price for your cleaning services. Offering online courses will enhance customer retention. But the most crucial benefit it provides is positioning your business as an industry expert and thought leader. Additionally, integrate sales enablement into this approach to empower your team to effectively promote these courses, ensuring that potential customers understand the value and resources available to them. Make sure to leverage the data collected in your CSP software to optimize your sales pipeline and identify areas where you can improve your conversion rates.

              A well-designed and intuitive user interface captures users' attention. It encourages them to stay longer on your website. Making it visually appealing and easy to navigate with clear calls to action is one good way to deliver it. However, it's not enough.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              You still need to conduct a comprehensive SEO audit of your website to identify areas for improvement. We'll dive deep into the website's technical performance:

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  Page speed refers to how quickly a web page loads in a user's browser. It is a critical factor that impacts both user experience and search engine optimization.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  A good rule of thumb is to have a website that loads quickly in real time, around 1-2 seconds. It will have lower bounce rates and higher engagement. If you're experiencing slow loading speed, you can optimize your website's page speed by using the following techniques:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                  <li>Minifying code</li>

                  <li>Leveraging browser caching</li>
                  <li>Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
                  Search engines like Google consider page speed as a ranking factor. So, find the sweet spot between a fast-loading website and maintaining quality content.
