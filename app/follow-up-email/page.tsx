            <strong>Reality Check:</strong> Along with a growth of response rates, the number of spam reports on each consecutive follow-up you send grows too. Unfortunately, there's currently no tool that would let us collect stats on this.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
            But the reality is a good portion of outreach emails land in spam folders - not because they have spam triggers, but because their senders abused outreach tactics earlier.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Gurus say you should create an entire sequence of follow-ups. Opinions differ on the exact number, but I've seen suggestions of up to nine follow-ups.
            </p>

                "As with most things in the world of SEO, the answer is this – it depends. If you know the podcaster personally, you can get away with more follow-ups than you could if you were reaching out to a stranger. But in any case, you have to weigh your follow-up against the risk of alienating them."

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                "You never know what someone is going through at any given point, so be mindful that their lack of response could have nothing to do with you, and may just be indicative that they're overwhelmed at the moment."

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Three emails spread at least a week or more apart. Consider emailing once per quarter if no response, but work on building relationships through social media in the meantime.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Gurus say the fortune is in follow-ups. The competition in people's inboxes is huge. If you give up too soon, someone else will show up and reap the benefits.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
            Follow-ups are about building relationships, not just getting responses. Every interaction should add value and respect the recipient's time and preferences. Quality relationships built through thoughtful follow-ups will serve you much better than aggressive follow-up sequences that burn bridges.
