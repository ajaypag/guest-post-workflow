        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Does Scholarship Link Building Still Work?</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When I was doing my research for this article, I found out that a shocking amount of people are convinced that this tactic simply does not work anymore. So, does it?
        </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">‚úÖ Yes, scholarship link building still works.</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Despite the belief that this tactic is dead, it is perfectly viable to this day. But, as with everything, there is a trick to it, and you need to know what you're doing in order to see success with this strategy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          Before we move on, let's take a look at why people would say scholarship link building is dead. And the reason for this is simple: too many businesses have offered too many scholarships to too many schools and didn't follow-up on their promises too many times. So, when students applied for these scholarships and ended up receiving nothing, that left a bit of a sour aftertaste. As a result, a lot of schools actually stopped receiving scholarships from third-party businesses because of the fear of getting scammed.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As with everything, there are some downsides to building links using scholarships. But, let's take a look at the pros first.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How Much Does a Campaign Cost? Not so Obvious Fees</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The biggest determining factor in this question is how much money are you willing to give out on scholarships. You could offer $5000, or you could offer $500 per scholarship, and end up getting pretty much the same result.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">üí∞ Cost Breakdown</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You can expect to land at least 15-30 responses from 200 outreach emails, basically landing you 15-30 backlinks for one scholarship. If you're offering $500, that sounds more than a fair deal, especially considering that the average price for a backlink built by an agency is about $250.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Total Campaign Cost:</strong> Around $2,000 for a $500 scholarship (including page creation, outreach, and review costs)

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Yes. They will. But there are some misconceptions floating around .EDU links actual worth. Some people think that .EDU and .GOV links are more valuable simply because they are governmental. In reality, Google treats all links the same way, regardless of their domain.

            <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Age and Authority:</strong> .EDU websites are usually decades old with high authority</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Scholarship Links and Domain Authority (and Other Third-party Metrics)</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you're reading this article, you probably know your SEO and are aware of what Domain Authority is. For those of you who don't: Domain Authority (DA) is a metric originally created by Moz to determine the value of a website. Other tools also have their own versions of Domain Authority, with different names.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">‚ö†Ô∏è Important DA Reality Check</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            There is one problem with DA. And that is the fact that it is based only on data that a single tool has access to. And only Google has access to all your data.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Key Point:</strong> A higher Domain Authority does not always mean that your site performs better, gets more traffic, or ranks higher on Google.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Are the Links DoFollow or NoFollow?</h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              <strong>Both.</strong> It all depends on the university. Some will place followable links, while other ones will assign it the NoFollow attribute.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              In fact, most of your links will be followable (DoFollow).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-green-50 rounded-lg p-6">

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Another common misconception is that NoFollow links don't help your SEO. That is simply not true.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Google knows about all of your links, including NoFollow ones, and likely takes them into consideration.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How to Get Backlinks from Awesome Colleges?</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I already mentioned that too many colleges got scammed by businesses, which lead to a lot of schools changing their stance on accepting external scholarships.
        </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            <strong>Primary Focus:</strong> Most of your link building targets will be smaller, local establishments.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Big Universities:</strong> Still possible but less frequent. For example, Lamar University accepts external scholarships - you just need to hit a button to submit.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              In order to get the most out of your links, you need to ensure relevance between what your business does and what your target school teaches. Relevancy matters a lot in SEO, and you'll get industry-specific content from essay submissions.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The majority of your prospects should be in the same area as you. Sure, you could offer scholarships worldwide, but would it actually help with your local SEO?

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">‚úÖ Check Prospect Websites Manually</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Most schools won't email you when your link is live. You'll have to check yourself to see if they've implemented it. Their webmasters usually have more than just their website to worry about.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Do it in batches, so you can take note of what works and what doesn't for your outreach, and improve it on-the-fly. It's also easier to deal with responses in manageable chunks.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Use tools like Ahrefs to look for outbound links on university websites. Schools that link to other resources are much more likely to be open for scholarships.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            What Google isn't fine with, though, is link schemes. "Low-quality directory or bookmark site links" is one of the categories that fall into the link scheme description.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            This isn't going to be a problem for bigger colleges with high-authority websites, but smaller, lesser-known schools' scholarship pages can sometimes appear as low-quality directory sites.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Good News:</strong> The worst that can happen is your link gets disregarded by the algorithm - no more penalties for unnatural links.

            When you're coming up with scholarship ideas, you have to think of something related to your business. The more relevant the connection, the better the SEO value and content you'll receive.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Remember:</strong> You make the rules! If you're going to go through hundreds of applications, might as well have some fun with it. Don't limit yourself and the students to boring essays.
