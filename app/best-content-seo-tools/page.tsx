        But SEO today is vastly different from what it used to be. Stuffing your content with keywords and adding backlinks left and right will not get you the results.
      </p>

      <p>
        SEO, as it exists today, is a sophisticated technique that is influenced by the audience's behavior. It is an amalgamation of both on-page and off-page tactics that help you rank higher on SERPs. And there are some great tools to help you with that.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this article, we'll be covering some excellent on-page and off-page SEO software that can help you achieve your growth objectives.
      </p>

      <h2>What is on-page and off-page SEO?</h2>

      <p>
        A well-rounded SEO strategy comprises on-page SEO and off-page SEO. Think of them as two sides of the same coin. With on-page SEO techniques, you'll be optimizing those sections (of your website) that you have control over.
      </p>

      <p>
        The focus of on-page SEO is on producing good content with keyword optimization, the right title tags, and more. Utilizing an on-page SEO checker can help ensure that your website meets best practices by analyzing key factors like meta tags, headings, and content structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        With off-page SEO, on the other hand, the focus is on increasing your website's authority on the search engine results pages (SERPs) through various measures. Off-page SEO consists of link building, link exchange, and other techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both of these techniques are important for the success of an SEO campaign.
      </p>
