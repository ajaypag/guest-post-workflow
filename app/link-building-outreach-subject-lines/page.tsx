          As a link builder, SEO specialist, or sales rep, email marketing is a pivotal tool in your outreach arsenal.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But encouraging your audience to open your emails doesn't always come easy … does it?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          With other brands competing for your target customer's attention, you may be constantly wondering how to position yourself to stand out among the rest.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> While there's no "foolproof" strategy for winning over a crowded inbox, the good news is you can do your best to get your foot in the door quicker.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            By taking the time to thoroughly plan your email subject lines, you can stimulate curiosity, demonstrate benefits, and (if all goes well) nudge your recipients toward conversion.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Ready to learn more about how to create link building outreach subject lines that get opened?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Let's begin!
        </p>

        <h2 id="know-target-customer" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">1. Know Your Target Customer</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          What kinds of brands will you be reaching out to and why? What industry are they in? What's their company size? How can link building and recruitment marketing help them reach their brand visibility and authority goals?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In this step, get laser-clear on your target customer.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Then, decide who you'll be reaching out to, specifically.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Which brings us to …
        </p>

        <h2 id="create-outreach-list" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">2. Create your link building outreach list</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Take a look at your LinkedIn prospecting list, email list, outreach list, and CRM and decide which brands you'll be reaching out to. Start by choosing the hottest leads and then the warm ones. Fill out the rest of your list with relevant cold prospects.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> When targeting cold leads, try asking for a small request first. As you build trust, you can start increasing your offer requests little by little.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            For instance, if you wanted to offer link building services to a SaaS company, like PetScreening, you might ask if the team can meet with you for a brief 15 minute call before offering your services.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Or, you could start the trust-building process early by sharing awesome results you helped other SaaS companies in the pet sector get. More on this in a bit.
        </p>

        <h2 id="understand-core-needs" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">3. Understand Your Target Customer's Core Needs (and how you can solve them with link building strategies)</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Putting yourself in your target customer's shoes is essential to understanding what their core needs are and how you can fulfill them with your link building solutions.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Once you're clear on how to meet their needs, you can create inspired and personalized subject lines with them in mind.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Example Use Cases</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Credit Card Rewards Company:</strong> If the company is struggling to convince high authority websites to feature its links, you can position yourself as an outreach expert that already has websites ready to feature the company's links.</li>
            <li><strong>B2B Cyber Security Brand:</strong> If they're having trouble finding guest post writers well-versed in cyber security (especially for advanced features like DDoS protection), you can address this pain point head-on by sharing who on your team has ample experience writing guest posts for cybersecurity blogs.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="improve-deliverability" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">4. Improve Your Email Deliverability Rate</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Improve the chances of your email making it to your recipient's inbox by following these email deliverability rate tips:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Email Deliverability Best Practices</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Stay away from terms that could be flagged as spam (check with your email provider for a full list of spammy words)</li>
            <li>Use a professional email address that includes your first and last name</li>
            <li>Don't send from an email address that has a brand name, symbols, numbers, or inappropriate terms</li>
            <li>Add a headshot to your email profile — it'll pop up next to your email address in the recipients inbox, demonstrating that you're a real professional</li>
            <li>Use an email verification tool to scan and confirm that all of your recipient addresses are correct and active</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="conduct-research" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">5. Conduct Research</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To see which other subject lines have seen success, carve out time in your schedule to study articles, guides, and marketing books.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You might also consider attending training and seminars or taking a link building outreach course. You may need a SharePoint calendar to schedule these trainings if you're going to take them as a group.
        </p>

        <h2 id="create-subject-lines" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">6. Create your subject lines</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          And finally, brainstorm and create your subject lines! When possible, personalize subject lines by addressing recipients by name — or, at the very least, do so when you greet them in the email body.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When creating your subject lines, keep your target customer, their core needs, and your research top-of-mind.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Here are some subject lines you can refer to for inspiration.
