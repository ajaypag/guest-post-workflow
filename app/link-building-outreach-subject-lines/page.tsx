          <li>Ready to learn more about how to create link building outreach subject lines that get opened?</li>
          <li>Let’s begin!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="1-know-your-target-customer">1. Know Your Target Customer</h2>

        <p>What kinds of brands will you be reaching out to and why? What industry are they in? What’s their company size? How can link building and recruitment marketing help them reach their brand visibility and authority goals?
In this step, get laser-clear on your target customer.
Then, decide who you’ll be reaching out to, specifically.
Which brings us to …</p>

        <h2 id="2-create-your-link-building-outreach-list">2. Create your link building outreach list</h2>

        <p>Take a look at your Linkedin prospecting list, email list, outreach list, and CRM and decide which brands you’ll be reaching out to. Start by choosing the hottest leads and then the warm ones. Fill out the rest of your list with relevant cold prospects.
Pro tip: When targeting cold leads, try asking for a small request first. As you build trust, you can start increasing your offer requests little by little.
For instance, if you wanted to offer link building services to a SaaS company, like PetScreening, you might ask if the team can meet with you for a brief 15 minute call before offering your services.
Or, you could start the trust-building process early by sharing awesome results you helped other SaaS companies in the pet sector get. More on this in a bit.</p>

        <h2 id="3-understand-your-target-customer-s-core-needs-and-how-you-can-solve-them-with-link-building-strategies-">3. Understand Your Target Customer’s Core Needs (and how you can solve them with link building strategies)</h2>

        <p>Putting yourself in your target customer’s shoes is essential to understanding what their core needs are and how you can fulfill them with your link building solutions.
Once you’re clear on how to meet their needs, you can create inspired and personalized subject lines with them in mind.
For instance, if you’d like to reach out to a credit card rewards company, you might discover that the company is struggling to convince high authority websites to feature its links. In this case, you can position yourself as an outreach expert that already has websites ready to feature the company’s links.
Or if you want to reach out to a B2B cyber security brand specializing in advanced features like  DDoS protection, you might discover the brand is having trouble finding guest post writers that are well-versed in cyber security.
In this case, you can address its pain point head-on by sharing who on your team has ample experience writing guest posts for cybersecurity blogs.</p>

        <h2 id="4-improve-your-email-deliverability-rate">4. Improve Your Email Deliverability Rate</h2>

        <p>Improve the chances of your email making it to your recipient’s inbox by following these email deliverability rate tips:
• Stay away from terms that could be flagged as spam (check with your email provider for a full list of spammy words)
• Use a professional email address that includes your first and last name
• Don’t send from an email address that has a brand name, symbols, numbers, or inappropriate terms
• Add a headshot to your email profile — it’ll pop up next to your email address in the recipients inbox, demonstrating that you’re a real professional
• Use an email verification tool to scan and confirm that all of your recipient addresses are correct and active</p>

        <h2 id="5-conduct-research">5. Conduct Research</h2>

        <p>To see which other subject lines have seen success, carve out time in your schedule to study articles, guides, and marketing books.
You might also consider attending training and seminars or taking a link building outreach course. You may need a SharePoint calendar to schedule these trainings if you’re going to take them as a group.</p>

        <h2 id="6-create-your-subject-lines">6. Create your subject lines</h2>

        <p>And finally, brainstorm and create your subject lines! When possible, personalize subject lines by addressing recipients by name — or, at the very least, do so when you greet them in the email body.
When creating your subject lines, keep your target customer, their core needs, and your research top-of-mind.
Here are some subject lines you can refer to for inspiration.</p>

Note that the better your email’s subject line fits in the scope of interest of your buyer persona, the higher open rate you’ll get at the end of your campaign.</p>

        <h2 id="7-test-your-subject-lines">7. Test your subject lines</h2>

        <p>After you’ve brainstormed and created plenty of link building outreach subject line options, run A/B testing campaigns to discover which lines perform best.
You can also send out surveys and questionnaires, ask a focus group, or  hire  an experienced  virtual assistant to handle testing for you.</p>

        <h2 id="8-create-finalize-and-automate-your-campaigns">8. Create, finalize, and automate your campaigns</h2>

        <p>Once you have a feel for the subject lines that perform best, start creating, finalizing, and automating your outreach campaigns.
Segment your campaigns by prospect type and schedule them to send automatically.
There’s a caveat here, though.
While automating your campaigns is essential to streamlining your outreach processes, it’s vital to stay armed and ready to respond to and nurture prospects when you get a reply from them.
In other words, make sure you know how to continue the conversation effectively so you can nudge your prospect closer to the finish line — otherwise known as conversion.
And that brings us to …</p>

        <h2 id="9-create-follow-up-sequences">9. Create follow-up sequences</h2>

        <p>Keep the outreach momentum going by staying in touch with prospects, even if they haven’t said yes to you or responded to any of your emails.
Speed up the process by using tools like follow-up email templates and an AI-powered sales outreach platform.
When creating your follow-up sequences, segment your customers by pain point, need, or other pertinent information, such as:
• Time of last follow-up
• Core solution you’re presenting
• Industry
• Business size
• Sales revenue
• Competitor score
Continue building a relationship with the prospect over time until they become your customer. If you discover the target customer isn’t a good fit for your brand, consider removing them from your outreach list or spacing out your follow-up emails in case their needs change.</p>

        <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>

        <p>Email marketing is a pivotal tool in your outreach arsenal.
But that doesn’t mean that convincing your audience to open your emails comes easily.
With other brands on the hunt for your target customer’s attention, knowing how to stand out among the rest is crucial. While fool-proof strategies don’t exist, there are still best practices you can use to get one step closer to converting your prospects.
And that’s why taking the time to thoroughly plan your link building outreach subject lines is so important.
If you’re ready to get your foot in the door quicker, we hope today’s article has inspired you to create email subject lines that convert.
That’s it for today, friends.
To your campaign’s success
