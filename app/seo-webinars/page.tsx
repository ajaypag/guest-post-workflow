          Every online marketer worth their salt knows what a backlink is. It's an incredibly simple concept. You, as a website owner, convince another website owner to include a link on their website that points back to your website. Like I said, simple right? Well… Yes and no. While backlinks in and of themselves are simple, understanding how to build backlinks the right way is not. With the constant updates to Google's algorithm and best practices, the very same tactics that once landed you on the first page for your target keyword can now result in massive search engine penalties. All in all… building backlinks can quickly become a minefield of mistakes and mishaps for the uninformed SEO.
