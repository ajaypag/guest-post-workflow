        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You found some template in Google, made a few quick edits, sent your pitch to many recipients, and ended up with results as if you did no outreach at all. If you're not your own boss, you must have felt ashamed to report such a "progress" to your manager.

          For years, I've received tons of email pitches made wrong and, truth be told, sent no better pitches myself. No friendly tone, no decent personalization, no emphasis on the value for recipients…

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I bet that's exactly what you're missing too.

          Let me guide you on how to write an outreach email pitch with all the key points in mind. At the end of the day, you should get closer to your prospects and further away from their spam folders.

            <strong>Important Promise:</strong> Before I start talking about how to write an email outreach pitch, I want you to promise one thing – you will not send spam emails to anyone no matter how tempting it might be.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Yeah, you probably nod your head and say you're not sending spam emails, but in practice, you still do so. Remember when you last opened a spammy email? What did it feel like? What did you do right after?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Don't make others feel the same way!
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          OK, now let's get back to the guide on how to write a great outreach email.
        </p>

        <h2 id="subject-lines" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How to write email subject lines that get opened</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The first roadblock on your way to a successful email marketing campaign is your subject line.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Day by day, bloggers get their inboxes filled with outreach emails of any kind – newsletters, guest post offers, interview requests, and a lot of spam that doesn't always make its way to the corresponding folder. No one physically can read them all. To streamline the email sorting process and prioritize genuine outreach, bloggers can benefit from using an SPF checker, ensuring that authentic messages from trusted sources stand out in their inboxes.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If your subject line gets lost among others, your pitch will remain unopened.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Check out the best practices for cold email subject lines. I included those that helped me increase the open rates of my letters.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Cut your email subject line length</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Long email subject lines get truncated in inboxes, especially when people check them on smartphones. And we're all on the go today, aren't we?
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Minimize your email subject length so that it could fit on the screen of any size. It'll improve your open rates on mobile devices.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Being a foreword, your subject shouldn't reveal everything you have to say. Just drop a hint of what your message is about or how it's related to your outreach prospects.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> Don't take my words too literally. Yes, your subject line should be short, but not so short that it doesn't convey the main idea of your email pitch.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Let's take the "about SEO" subject, for example. Are they going to hire me as an SEO for their project? Do they want to discuss some SEO news like the latest Google algorithm update? Have they noticed any SEO issues on my blog?
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Forcing people to make such guesses is nothing but bad manners. It can also give them a feeling that your pitch is one of many other spam emails landing in their inboxes day in, day out.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Avoid capitalization in email subject lines</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> A lot of personal outreach emails remain unnoticed because they look like automated newsletters.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          We all know the rule to use capital letters in post titles. By analogy, email subject lines are titles of our emails, but this rule doesn't work here.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Email subject capitalization only gives a licked-clean, promo look to a message.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Your goal is to send a pitch reminding of a friend's message. Do you ever capitalize words when chatting with your buddies? I don't.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Use lowercase letters only in your subject lines.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Here's how an all-lowercase subject stands out among newsletters in the inbox.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Note.</strong> It's justified to capitalize email subject words like acronyms or, say, personal names.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Make your email subject lines sound relevant</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> When people read your subject line, it should ring a bell for them. If it doesn't, they will just scroll it by, thinking your outreach email has nothing to do with them.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> The most opened subject lines are those that sound relevant to recipients. To achieve such an effect, use their post titles.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          That way, you won't need to specify which post you're referring to in the email body. Such a subject makes it obvious and helps you reduce your email length (more on this in the next section).
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> Don't copy and paste the entire post title. It'll only make your subject longer and give it a hint of automation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If you copied and pasted the title, the odds are your entire message is a matter of copy and paste too. Such a thought will push recipients away if they notice your email at all.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Due to copy-pasted titles, personal outreach emails don't stand out among newsletters visually. Guess which of the three emails below is personal 🙂
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Shorten post titles to keywords only. That'd be enough to let your prospects know which post is on your mind.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Arouse some curiosity with your email subject line</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> To read boring emails at the end of the day or close the mailbox and go home, that is the question…
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The answer is often not in your favor, I'm afraid.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Without engaging email subject lines, people will be reluctant to read your entire message. That's something I can say with confidence, from personal experience.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Arouse your outreach prospects' curiosity with a question about their content.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Logically, everyone who's interested to write about some topic should also be interested to discuss their write-up consequently. Many recipients will be curious to check what kind of question you have.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> Don't ask your question directly in the subject line. People can say no in their minds and move on to other email pitches, leaving yours unopened.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Also, your question will make more sense in the context of your arguments rather than on its own.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Accentuate the value for your outreach prospects</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> People skip many outreach emails because they don't see any value there. Just another hard sell or stuff like that.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Can you blame them?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Many outreachers are focused on their own benefits only. Asking for links and shares, they aren't ready to give anything in return.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          That's why folks have been quite skeptical about unsolicited email pitches lately.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> The best subject lines to get emails opened are those that accentuate the value for recipients.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Tell your outreach prospects that you have an idea or tip for their content.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          No one's canceled a writer's block after all. Many bloggers face it at one time or another but few admit though 🙂
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Your content idea offer should motivate them to open your email and check if it's worthwhile.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you've done a case study, offer bloggers to embed your graphs in their articles. That way, they'll back up their ideas with stats instead of sounding proof-less.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Important Warning: Avoid Clickbait</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Don't use clickbait tricks to increase your email open rates</li>
            <li>You're not the one who'll provide "big help" - it's your prospect who will help you with a backlink</li>
            <li>Don't call your ideas "awesome," "exclusive," "great," etc. - self-praise isn't respected</li>
            <li>Avoid fake flattery like "your amazing blog" - everyone knows you're being insincere</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I want to assure you that everyone knows you're insincere. When they see your link request at the end of your message, you'll prove that one more time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Don't let such dirty tricks alienate your prospects from you.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Another way to increase email deliverability rate and boost the email credibility is by securing your email domain. You can check your email security compliances with an email header analyzer.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> When people have to deal with lots of emails, the last thing they want is empty talk.
        </p>

          Talkers and other time wasters are out of favor. So are their pitches with vague subject lines.

            Every content guru out there suggests doing research. As a result, so many people are doing case studies these days, but how is yours different?

          If you still want to prove that your findings aren't taken out of nowhere, mention your content type in brackets at the end. It can be an interview of a niche influencer, a survey of many product users, or your test results.

        <h2 id="email-format" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">What is the correct email format in outreach</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Once your subject line passes face control, your outreach prospects will open your email where things usually go wrong.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Before even reading the first line, they'll evaluate your message by eye. Make sure it doesn't look overwhelming and has nothing that could turn them off.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You can use email validation to ensure that your outreach reaches only valid, engaged recipients, increasing your chances of maintaining a strong sender reputation and improving open rates.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          However, it is important to learn how to format an email pitch in a way to retain your prospects at this to-read-or-not-to-read stage.

        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          They use formal, complicated language that's hard to read – long sentences, complex grammatical constructions, and fancy words that you can find mainly in classic works of literature.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Many outreachers tell their prospects how much they love their blogs, particularly articles they want backlinks from. But such fake love confessions don't work, sorry.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            So, Anthony, you've been reading my blog for years. Hmm, where are your likes, shares, and comments? Why can't I find you in my subscriber base? Why have you linked to none of my articles over these years if you like them so much?

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Outreachers are usually quick to write an email pitch and hit the send button. It takes them only a few seconds to notice spelling mistakes afterward.

          While it's no big deal to make a few typos when messaging pals, outreach emails require more attention to detail. There should be nothing that your prospects could find fault with.

        <h2 id="pitch-structure" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How to structure an email pitch</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As mentioned in the previous section, your outreach email should be short, basically around ten sentences.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          There's no place for any digressions from the main point of your campaign. But I'm amazed how much info that's beside the point outreachers sometimes shove into their pitches.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Just like every article consists of a few major parts (an opening, main part, conclusion), there's a predefined structure of an email too.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Here are the main email parts you should include in your pitch.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Email greetings</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> When you don't address your outreach prospects by name, it's a red flag that your message ended up in hundreds of other mailboxes.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Unfortunately, bulk email senders don't get bulk replies.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The worst part is that people will figure things out without even opening your email. The snippet with its first line is visible right in the inbox.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Imagine how the lack of a personal email greeting will affect your open rates.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> If you wonder how to address people in email pitches, the answer is obvious – by name!
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In such a simple way, you'll show that you actually know who you contact. It's in our DNA to want to check out stuff addressed to us personally, at least out of curiosity.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Avoid These Generic Greetings</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Don't use "Dear Editor," "Dear Sir," "Dear Madam," etc.</li>
            <li>Such formal address won't show respect - it shows laziness</li>
            <li>It proves you didn't bother to check out their names</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          A proper email greeting is the easiest way of personalization but many outreachers still fail here.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Email opening lines</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Email opening lines are notorious for being the most irrelevant part that recipients usually skip over.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When thinking about the ways to start an email, many outreachers tell a backstory about themselves, their interests, companies, products, whatever.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But who cares if all you want is a backlink.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Your pitch isn't your CV. Such a backstory will only load your email with a few extra paragraphs to read. Taking someone's time goes against email introduction etiquette.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Skip the intro of yourself in your email intro. Sounds like a paradox, doesn't it?
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Instead, let your outreach prospects know you've read their article and explain how it's related to you. As easy as that.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> If your outreach campaign is all about your product rather than your content, sure thing you can drop a few words about it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Let's say you want to get your product featured in a compilation of similar items. Feel free to list its USPs (unique selling points) to convince your prospects it's worth a mention. But your email opener isn't the right part to tell about your product USPs. You should mention them in a different part of an email, which you'll learn about below.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Outreach excuse</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> The most important part of an email is your outreach excuse, the notion I first saw in this sarcastic post.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In simple terms, this is the reason why you contact your outreach prospects and, most importantly, why they should be interested in your offer.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          No, gaining a backlink from them isn't the right excuse. Neither is the fact that you've written an article on the same topic they link to.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          That's where many outreachers screw things up.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Having a similar article is the most overused excuse that makes no sense at all. There are many similar articles out there, so what? Why on earth should bloggers add a link to yours?
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Similar to products, content can have a USP too. That's what makes it unique compared to many other articles on the same topic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          There are two points to accentuate in this email part:

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Two Key Points for Your Outreach Excuse</h4>
          <ul className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>What you've found out as a result of your research, i.e. the USP of your article;</li>
            <li>How your prospects and their readers can benefit from your findings.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In general, you can either contradict the main point of the article your prospects link to or bring more value than that article provides.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Contradiction.</strong> People interested in some topic usually want to explore it from different angles. That's a perfect excuse to show up in their mailboxes and tell them your research proves the opposite of what the article they link to says.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>More value.</strong> If you have no contradictory arguments, emphasize the additional value your content provides. The value that the article they link to is missing.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you follow the email writing tips above, you should have no problems with your outreach excuse.

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Excuses That Don't Work</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> Having a similar article isn't the only outreach excuse doomed to failure. Anything unspecific like a more detailed or up-to-date article is a no-go too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If you say your content is more up-to-date, clarify what exactly went out of date in the article your prospects link to. You can't only indicate a problem without providing a solution. It's just useless. You should also suggest a fresh alternative to the outdated stuff for the time being.
          </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Email closing lines</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Here comes a culmination of your outreach email, when you need to tell folks what you want.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Outreachers can be quite impudent in email closing lines. Some of them beg for backlinks as if their prospects owe them.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Do you know how people treat pushy salesmen? The same goes for pushy outreachers.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Unless your prospects live under a rock, they should know that Google bans sites for any link manipulations.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Seeing a blunt backlink request in your email closing, they'll wonder if it could get them in trouble somehow.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Tactfully ask people about the possibility to get your article or tool featured in their content. That's the best way to end an email.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Avoid any backlink-related wording. Instead of "add my backlink," use phrases like "refer to my study" or "suggest my findings to your readers."

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> While impudent begging can push your outreach prospects away, veiled requests can confuse them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For example, if you ask for a content share in your email ending, that's exactly what you may get – a share on social media.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            It's a faux pas to follow up and ask them one more favor, i.e. a backlink. Especially if you offer nothing in return.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Let people understand that you suggest a link without saying it out loud.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          For example, you can say you want a share with their blog readers. Such a clarification will make it obvious that things should go on their blog rather than on Twitter, Facebook, etc.

        <h2 id="personalization" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How to personalize email pitches</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Ever felt a forbidden desire to stalk someone? This is your chance to fulfill it and, most importantly, to do it legally.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Addressing your outreach prospects by name isn't the alpha and omega of email personalization. It's the easiest, most primitive thing you can do. You may use an email finder to find both the emails and information, including the names, company names, and positions you can use for personalization.

          To go further, try to mention something personal that you have in common with them.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          First, it'll help you get them on your side, as people are friendlier to like-minded individuals.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Second, you'll show them that you've bothered to check more than their email address.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Social media, particularly Twitter, is a true goldmine for email personalization. You can find there what your prospects have been up to both in their private and professional lives.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Here's how to personalize emails based on those insights.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Use your prospects' interests for email personalization</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Since we all hang out on social media today, it's no big deal to check someone's likes and dislikes. Everything is out in the open.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But the thing is it's a true art to make a comment on point.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Saying you like their favorite movie too is not enough. Such email personalization fails most of the time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          There are millions of other fans around the world. What's the point of your comment? How does it set you apart from the masses?
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Comment on your prospects' favorites only if your words can be of any benefit to them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You can tell them the latest news on their fav TV show or make a joke about its last episode. If you can't think of anything like that, check Google's News tab.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Example: Stranger Things Fan</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For example, Anna seems to be a fan of Stranger Things, according to her Twitter bio.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In your email pitch, don't say you're a fan of the show too. Better let her know that Netflix has finally announced the release date for the upcoming season.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Since they made an announcement only a few days ago, Anna may not know about it yet. Imagine how grateful she will be for your heads-up.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As such info is unrelated to your pitch, feel free to add one more email part – P.S.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Besides hobbies, people often reveal something distinctive about them in Twitter bios. You can refer to those one-liners in your email closing lines or outreach excuse.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What NOT to Use for Personalization</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> Unfortunately, you can't use every piece of info posted on Twitter for email personalization, at least as is.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            If the info is too general, and you have no time to look for specifics, don't comment on that point at all.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Adam says he's into sports - too general unless you know specific sports</li>
            <li>Many people have pets - won't surprise anyone if you say you love dogs too</li>
            <li>Only specific info like "Vikings fan" can work effectively</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Be ready that your comment can develop into a long talk. Make sure you have a good understanding of the topic you briefly mentioned.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If it turns out that you know nothing but the name of his fav team, that'll be a shame.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Personalize mass emails with your prospects' professional activities</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Showing interest in what your outreach prospects do as opposed to what they like, you can get even closer to them. But it'll work only if you know a thing or two about their undertakings.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          While you might be lucky to watch the same series, you can't have bought products from all the 200 prospects on your list. And I bet you have no time to watch 200 webinars each of them recorded, right?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Still, you can't praise their product or speech at some event without a single proof point.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          It's crystal clear that you're saying good words to butter them up. But in reality, you don't give a damn about their work. That's not how email marketing personalization works.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Mention something professional only if you have at least a rough idea of how things work there. You'll need to back up your comment with some proof to convince people you're sincere.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Here's some food for thought.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When people receive your outreach email, they understand there's always some benefit for you behind it all. What they also understand is that they'll get no more than a "thank you" note out of this.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Still, they'll have to spend their time on you – read your post, enter the admin panel, embed your link, edit its anchor, and adapt the surrounding text to it.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I'm sorry to say this but many people aren't inclined to volunteer. That's why email response rates don't fulfill our expectations in most cases.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> You'll find it easier to convince your outreach prospects to do you a favor if you can pay them back.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            No, I'm not talking about money now. You can do much more for them than you can think of. And it won't cost you a dime.

          Check out a few hacks to boost the response rates of your email pitches.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Get on your outreach prospects' radar ahead</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Not everyone is willing to reply to strangers, let alone do them a favor. And they have every right to ignore unsolicited outreach emails, I'm afraid.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Get into your prospects' lives before showing up in their inboxes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Social media is a perfect place to attract attention to yourself. You can like their posts, share them with your followers, and exchange a couple of words.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Social Media Pre-Outreach Examples</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Abby</strong> thanks everyone who tweets her Google Discover study - if you do it too, she'll recognize you when your email comes</li>
            <li><strong>Aleh</strong> likes retweets of his guest contributions - yours should be much appreciated too</li>
            <li><strong>Lily</strong> responds to comments on her case study - that's how you can get on her radar upfront with meaningful, timely comments</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you have a low response rate, this trick will increase it a bit.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Don't comment on old posts, unless you found something groundbreaking about that topic. Better focus on fresh articles that your outreach prospects are promoting now.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Important Note:</strong> Make sure you have the same name and avatar in your email and Twitter accounts. If you have a different pic in your mailbox, it may not ring a bell for them. All your efforts will be in vain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Do what your outreach prospects ask</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Some people call their followers to do them a favor. That's your opportunity to build a bridge between you and them at an early stage.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But outreachers often go over the edge here, making their little help look like a bribe.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you voted for some item in their survey, it doesn't give you the full right to demand something bigger like a backlink. Come on, it took you a few seconds and one click only!
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Do what your prospects ask, but make it sound like a "by-the-way" note rather than a favor they should return. Especially since people don't ask for anything difficult or time-consuming, as a rule.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 mb-8">

            <li><strong>Danielle</strong> seeks advice on marketing materials - mention helpful resources in your email closing</li>
            <li><strong>Clark</strong> shares a link to join his mailing list - tell him how his newsletters helped you (not just that you joined)</li>
            <li><strong>Beverley</strong> calls followers to register for her free webinar - let her know you're her 71st student and what problem you hope she'll help solve</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Timing Warning:</strong> Always pay attention to the timeliness of your prospects' requests. What mattered yesterday doesn't always matter today. Alexander's interview was published more than a year ago, so it's kinda too late to vote it up.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Point out an issue on your outreach prospect's site</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Any issue on the page doubles the excuse for your outreach prospects to update it.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The focus isn't on you anymore. It's on the need to bring their page back in order (and insert your backlink along the way).
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          People mostly use this strategy to indicate the issue of broken outgoing links. Broken link building is great and all, but it's become overused lately.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Check out if there are any other on-page issues. Some of them are visible to the naked eye, e.g. image issues.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In your outreach excuse, speculate on why that issue makes the page anything but user-friendly. Your request should make a connection to the necessity to edit that post.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Note.</strong> You can use site audit tools to find on-page issues if you can't notice anything with the naked eye. But don't be too technical. Otherwise, your message will look suspicious. People may wonder why you performed a technical audit of their site. How will you bluff it out?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Link out to your outreach prospects</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> The fact that you've linked to your outreach prospects will put your pitch over others. It'll increase your email campaign response rates for sure.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You may wonder what could be a problem here, but there's one.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Unfortunately, people usually don't give a second thought to this strategy. They just link to the homepage, which is already the most linked-to page in 99% of cases.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Such a backlink will be appreciated but not as much as backlinks to pages that have a few or no links at all.

          It especially makes sense when the author of your target post is a company founder or head of marketing rather than just a staff writer.

            <li><strong>Pages you want backlinks from</strong> (that's when your empty claims to like their content will turn into well-grounded statements)</li>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Important Warning About Link Exchanges</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Note.</strong> Better link out to your prospects from guest posts rather than from your blog.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Let's say you linked to a hundred sites from your domain, and they did the same for you in return. That's an obvious link exchange scheme, which Google forbids.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            My point is this strategy isn't for every prospect on your list. If you have hundreds, I doubt you'll be able to write so many guest posts to link to each one.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Set priority on stronger pages that:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6 ml-6">
          <li>have a higher page rating (UR) and domain rating (DR) scores, as they'll send you link juice of higher quality;</li>
          <li>drive organic traffic, as they can bring you some referral traffic besides link juice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Share your product with your outreach prospects</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Problem.</strong> Having a product that you can share with your outreach prospects is such a privilege. But some outreachers leave me speechless because of their greed.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Providing two-week access to your tool for free is not enough, to say the least.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          First, people can probably get it themselves by signing up for your free trial.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Second, your prospects may be too busy to use your tool straightaway. And the fact that you urge them on can cause the tension between you and them.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution.</strong> Share at least a few months of free access to your product.

        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          That way, they'll be able to check it out and hopefully get used to it after a while. When the time is up, some of them may ask you to extend their free accounts in exchange for more perks you'd like.

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if your prospects decline your backlink request, don't discontinue their free account. Tell them they're still welcome to use it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If people like your tool, they may turn into your paying customers or suggest it to their readers who may turn into your paying customers. Higher email response rates are just the tip of an iceberg here. Your generosity will pay off in all kinds of ways.

        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The problem with templates is that many people use them as is. Yeah, they add details like their names, post titles, and links, but hardly ever rephrase the default body text.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As a result, bloggers receive almost the same templated emails and understand they're not personal. Just look where we are now – "Delete" and "Report spam" have become the most clickable buttons in the inbox.

            <strong>Solution.</strong> Do a bit of rephrasing of your outreach email template copy. The templates below are more for email structuring rather than word-for-word usage.

          I hope I could guide you on how to write an outreach email pitch at every stage. None of these strategies is rocket science. All you need is some wit and a lot of practice.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Do A/B testing of different email subject lines, outreach excuses, personalization hacks, etc to figure out what works best with people in your niche.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you want to do outreach at scale, don't turn it into spam. Try to make the most of each email pitch you send, learning more about your outreach prospects beforehand. Yeah, you'll need to invest some time, but it'll help you boost response rates.
