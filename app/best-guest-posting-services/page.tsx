        <h2 id="best-guest-post-services-criteria">Best Guest Post Services Criteria</h2>

        <p>Guest posting is a great way to acquire the juiciest backlinks. One of the most white-hat techniques of all, the only downside that it has is the fact that writing articles for each link can be quite tedious and extremely time-consuming.
But you don’t actually need to do it yourself. There are plenty of guest posting services that are more than happy to do it for you.
A successful link building campaign can increase your website’s rankings, boost your traffic, and, as a result, increase your sales and conversions.
If you don’t quite know what you’re doing though, or hire an agency that utilizes shady strategies to acquire backlinks, you can damage your business. A lot.
That’s why we built this list. To help you choose only from the best, most professional, and, most importantly, proven services that do honest work.
Some of them offer content creation and promotion services, while others will require you to provide your own content for publications. There are even some rather unique self-services where all you need to do is to come up with a blog title and write the article slot in your post in a field, choose the websites you want it published on and that’s it.
So, if you need some assistance deciding which agency will be the right pick for you, by all means, feel free to scroll down and refer to our list.
> We messaged each provider individually, and asked them how to place an order, how much it will cost, which strategies they use, and took note of how long it took them to reply. We also checked their domains with Ahrefs to see what their Domain Ratings are and how many organic visitors they get per month.

        <p>## 1. Outreach Labs</p>

        <p>### Outreach Labs Review:</p>

        <p>It’s admittedly difficult to review oneself without bias, so, rather, let’s stick to the facts: you’re reading this list because we used our link-building service to rank this page high in Google with the same tactics we apply to client campaigns. That includes branded link building, custom blogger outreach, and of course, high-quality guest posts. We build guest posts in a unique way. Once you sign on as a client, we look to build private outreach networks (PONs) in your niche. Basically, instead of just pitching blogs for guest posts, which has become a hugely saturated tactic), they identify businesses who are actively doing outreach in your niche and collaborate with them.
For example, If we connect with a business that is guest posting on an authority site, we’ll try to get your backlinks added. In return, we’ll make sure to pull our weight on the returning value end. By making the effort to work our way into existing outreach, you end up cutting through the noise and getting amazing links. We also do the typical guest post prospecting and outreach, however, to cover the standard bases.
Outreach Labs is about creative link building. Our unique approach to guest posting will help you get the exposure you need to succeed.</p>

        <h3 id="outreach-labs-response-speed-">Outreach Labs Response Speed:</h3>

        <h3 id="outreach-labs-link-building-tactics-">Outreach Labs Link Building Tactics:</h3>

        <p>We offer two types of guest posts: under your brand name or under a name that is not your brand but where the content contains your links. You can also expect ghostwritten posts under the blog owner’s name that contain your links.
We don’t rely on paying bloggers for guest posts. Instead, we’ve built a process around getting deep into the outreach ecosystem of a particular niche and creating quality content. This ensures that your links are placed on high-quality sites that will actually drive traffic to your site.</p>

        <h3 id="outreach-labs-pricing-policy-">Outreach Labs Pricing Policy:</h3>

        <p>Our packages start at $1499, and our one-time guest posts start at $250. You choose a monthly budget, and they build a range of links within that package. Each link is assigned a monetary value based on the DR, traffic, and type of links it is. For example, if we score mostly high end links a particular month, the total links delivered will be less than if we’d scored mostly medium-authority links.</p>

        <h3 id="seo-skit">SEO SKIT</h3>

        <p>#### SEOSKit Review:</p>

        <p>SEOSKit is not one of the most famous names, but we decided to give them a try after getting some impressive feedbacks from partners. We decided to give a shot with their high DR link building service, and we were really satisfied.
The most impressive thing about the service was, despite every link coming from a high DR website, every single website was completely relevant to our business niche.
SEOSkit provides 100% white-hat guest posts with a proper anchor plan and assures post indexing. And depending on customer wants and needs, they offer a monthly backlink package and provide a success roadmap.
Starting from the ordering process to briefing them about our requirements, everything went smoothly. Their no bs approach definitely scored some extra points.</p>

        <p>#### Types of Backlinks SEOSkit Offers</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>High Authority Guest Posts</li>
          <li>Existing Post/Niche Edit Backlinks</li>
          <li>Google News Guest Posts</li>
          <li>Blogger Outreach</li>
          <li>Sponsored Backlinks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>#### SEOSKit Response Speed</p>

        <p>We tried to contact SEOSKit via Skype and got a response within 2 hours, whereas an email query takes around the same time to receive a response. Probably we got a quick response than usual, as they claim to respond to every query in less than 12 hours.</p>

        <p>#### SEOSKit Pricing</p>

        <p>The pricing of SEOSKit’s services highly depend on website traffic and DA. For a limited budget, one can purchase their basic $100 package which will get them a link from a website with 50k-100k/month traffic. There are also traffic-based packages named Startup, Medium, and Pro. The pro package for a guest post costs around $400, with the post being published on a website with 0.5-1M traffic.
However, if you want to purchase guest posts based on website domain authority, you can choose from DA 20 to DA 60+, which ranges from $100 to $399 per 1000 words. Not only that, there are so many authority guest posting offers and packages on the SEOSKit website.</p>

        <p>#### SEOSKit Link Building Tactics</p>

        <p>SEOSKit builds white hat links by outreaching relevant authority websites. This tactic greatly increases link value and helps linked webpages rank better on Google.</p>

        <p>#### How To Order from SEOSkit</p>

        <p>To order from SEOSKit, you must first choose your desired package from their website. Once you get in touch with SEOSKit, you can inform them of your requirements and submit your details. Once you have done it, you will get your guest posting report within a few days.</p>

        <p>#### SEOSKit’s Own SEO:</p>

        <p>SEOSKit’s website has a domain authority of 65+ and more than 700 backlinks. Not only that, but the site loads quickly on both mobile phones and desktop computers.</p>

        <h3 id="no-bs">NO-BS</h3>

        <p>#### How to Order from NO-BS:</p>

        <p>NO-BS functions primarily as a self-service platform with an extremely intuitive dashboard. The general process behind it looks something like this: you first create your account and fill in your campaign brief to let the team know what you’re looking for.

        <p>#### Does NO-BSDo Real Blogger Outreach?:</p>

        <p>The team does real outreach to relevant niche sites and can do it to your own list, so seems like no trickery is involved here. Though… don’t you think that it sounds too good to be true when a self-service platform agrees to do outreach to sites, not in their database..?</p>

        <p>#### NO-BS Pricing Policy:</p>

        <p>The prices depend on your target site’s Domain Authority and start at $150 per link.</p>

        <p>#### NO-BS’s Own SEO:</p>

        <p>#### Submit Core Response Speed:</p>

        <p>We took the email route and got no response, even after following up. Still, if you were to book a real consultation, one of the team members would surely get back to you in the shortest time possible.</p>

        <p>#### Submit Core’s Own SEO:</p>

        <p>The Submit Core website can only be crawled partly, so getting accurate data regarding their DR and organic traffic is outside of our reach.</p>

        <h3 id="fatjoe">FATJOE</h3>

        <p>#### FATJOE Review:</p>

        <p>FATJOE is a link building service provider for more than 1000 Agencies all over the world.</p>

        <p>#### How to Order from FATJOE:</p>

        <p>All orders are placed, managed, and tracked from your very own all-in-one dashboard. This makes it super easy to manage link building services for multiple clients.</p>

        <p>#### FATJOE Link Building Tactics:</p>

        <p>Just like with a lot of other vendors, FATJOE mainly scores you backlinks through guest posting. First, they reach out to relevant bloggers in your niche and evaluate the best opportunities.
Then, they produce content in a non-promotional style ensuring that it doesn’t look like it has been written for the sole purpose of getting a backlink. You can track all of the links built within your dashboard and get an email notification when your order is complete.</p>

        <p>#### FATJOE Response Speed:</p>

        <p>We submitted our questions through their contact form and got a reply the next morning.</p>

        <p>#### Does FATJOE Do Real Blogger Outreach?</p>

        <p>Disappointingly, they informed us that custom outreach isn’t really something they do but reassured that they understand the importance of posting on relevant resources and that all of the links built will fit into target websites organically.</p>

        <p>#### FATJOE Pricing Policy:</p>

        <p>FATJOE charges per placement starting at £35/link from low-DR websites and ranging up to £360/link from premium resources with at least a thousand organic monthly visitors.</p>

        <p>#### FATJOE ’s Own SEO:</p>

        <p>Their website’s Domain Rating is 56 and they get over 4,000 visitors coming from SERPs every month, so they have a pretty solid online foundation for their business.</p>

        <h3 id="the-hoth">The Hoth</h3>

        <p>#### The Hoth Review:</p>

        <p>The HOTH is an acronym for Hittem Over The Head, in other words, to bludgeon with awesomeness. It can be used as a noun (as in their product, or their brand) or as a verb (i.e. To HOTH someone, to HOTH something).
When the HOTH was started in 2010, the industry was plagued by sketchy service providers with poor support. The HOTH was to change all that. They became the best SEO company so you would have an amazing experience.
The HOTH put their names and faces on it, made support a priority, and gave out guarantees, developing an entire suite of products to fit your needs. They made a streamlined production system that allows the team to deliver their custom projects and campaigns with agility, speed, and scale. All in a nicely wrapped interface that produces results for you, day in, and day out.</p>

        <p>#### How to Order from The Hoth:</p>

        <p>You can schedule a free consultation and discuss your order with one of their account managers through an interactive calendar.</p>

        <p>#### The Hoth Link Building Tactics:</p>

        <p>The team employs lots of different strategies depending on the type of service you’ve selected.</p>

        <p>#### The Hoth Pricing Policy:</p>

        <p>The HOTH offers a variety of services from generating leads to improving your site’s SEO and, of course, link building.
As for link building services, there is quite a selection as well: HOTH GuestPost, HOTH GuestPost PRO, HOTH Foundations, HOTH Blitz, and HOTH Boost. Let’s look at them one by one.
The HOTH GuestPost package has a name that speaks for itself. It is your standard guest posting offer with pricings depending on the DA of the site linking to you, starting at $100/link from a DA 10+ resource up to $500/link for a 50+ DA site.
The difference between the regular and the PRO version of the HOTH GuestPost lies in how the prospects are chosen. In the PRO package, instead of looking at a site’s DA, the team looks at how much monthly organic traffic a resource is getting.
A link from a site with a thousand organic visitors will cost you $200, and if you’d like to go for bigger resources with up to 25,000 organic traffic the price will go up to $500. Sure, this service is a little bit more expensive, but organic traffic is also a more accurate representation of a site’s well-being than its Domain Authority.
Next up is the HOTH Foundations. To sum up how it works: firstly, the team sets up mini-authority properties on blogging platforms, where contextual links back to your site are placed in original, semantically relevant content. Of course, you have complete control over your anchor text.
The prices for this package range anywhere from $60 to $500 depending on the number of URLs, blogs, and whether you’re looking for regular or premium content.
You will find the HOTH Blitz offer interesting if you’re looking to quickly boost your secondary resource. The team has a lot of connections with websites from practically every niche out there. And this offer secures permanent backlinks in the homepage sidebars of those sites.
You can get 5 such links for as little as $250, 10 for $450, and 20 for $875.
Last but not least is the HOTH Boost. This offer gets you in-content links on high-DA resources to, once again, boost your secondary properties, social media posts, videos, etc.
It is also the cheapest, with two pricing choices: $49 and $149 for 50 and 250 posts respectively.
The HOTH offers a pretty impressive range of services which you will surely find helpful.</p>

        <p>#### The Hoth Response Speed:</p>

        <p>The initial response to our email directed us to their 27-page price list, which, while being very clear and informative can feel a little intimidating at first and it would be nice if someone explained how all those work in person.
They did offer to schedule a free consultation with one of their managers though, so they are redeemed. That reply came in the following morning by the way, which is not bad at all.</p>

        <p>#### Does The Hoth Do Real Blogger Outreach?</p>

        <p>The HOTH has an already impressive database of publishers who accept guest posts, but their number grows daily and they are open for custom outreach, so there’s zero doubt about the validity of their services.</p>

        <p>#### The Hoth ’s Own SEO:</p>

        <p>The HOTH website is huge with a DR of 72 and 86,400 monthly organic visitors, and they are very professional about how they approach every single task thrown at them.</p>
