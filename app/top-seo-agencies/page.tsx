            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Why Hire An SEO Company?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Reputable and experienced SEO firms will provide professional, tried, and tested strategies that will aid your business to rank organically over time. If you found an SEO company that promises you instant rank on page 1 in just a few hours, be wary. Generally, keyword rankings that are highly targeted and effective take time. SEO is often referred to for its slow-burning nature due to this reason. ROI can be achieved over many months. Additionally, SEO firms also benefit from the most effective tools available (which cost money for non-technical people), top resources, and up-to-date knowledge of the ever-changing nature of SEO.
