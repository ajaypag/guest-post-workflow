          <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">2024 Update Note</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This case study began September 2017 and lasted for 16 months. Organic traffic became our main lead driver and the content on the Linkio domain continues to rank well, often without any direct link building needed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The Linkio domain has also survived several of Google's algorithm updates. These early activities set up cool case studies where we were able to rank without any direct backlinks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I'm going to be real with you for a minute... Most SEO case studies suck.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Not because they're written by bad SEOs or lack accurate content and information. Rather they focus on the minor aspects of SEO. From optimizing H3 tags to fixing robot.txt files to ensuring obscure pages are indexed by Google, most case studies are written by SEOs for SEOs.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But in this case study, I'm not going to talk about any of that. I'm focused on the big picture - taking a completely unknown entity, a brand new domain, and turning it into something epic. Into an established, authoritative, and all around badass brand.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Key Strategy</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            After we set up the branding during the first couple of months, the only things my team and I focused on were content and links.
          </p>
          <ul className="text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>• Only published <strong>10 articles</strong> in total over 16 months</li>
            <li>• <strong>80% of our time</strong> was focused on links</li>
            <li>• Clear branding + quality content + lots of backlinks</li>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          On September 1st, 2017, Linkio was a brand new site. It was emptier than the waiting list for Trump's hair stylist and didn't have a single backlink, article, or visitor.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Despite these humble beginnings, it was our goal to turn Linkio.com into one of the most authoritative SEO sites on the internet. And we already had a battle-proven gameplan from our results with OutreachMama.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Month 2 was when we started seeing our first real traction. We continued our aggressive link building campaign and published our second piece of epic content.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This was the hardest month psychologically. We were putting in massive effort but seeing minimal returns. Classic SEO growing pains.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          We had to rebrand from our original name due to trademark issues. This set us back slightly but didn't derail our progress.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Months 5 & 6: The Flatline Continues</h2>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These months tested our resolve. Traffic remained flat, but we knew the links were building authority that would pay off later.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Months 3-6 are typically the hardest for new sites. You're doing everything right but seeing minimal results. This is where most people give up. Don't be most people.

          Even at month 11, we had periods of stagnation. SEO is not a linear game. There are ups and downs, but the overall trend was positive.
