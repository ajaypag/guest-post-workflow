          Ever spent a lot of time on link prospecting but ended up with miserable results? You're not alone.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The whole process seems straightforward. Take a backlink checker, download websites linking to content and product like yours, and voila! Your list of link building prospects is ready.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          No rocket science.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But the problem is everyone who promotes their business via blogger outreach and link building follows the same blueprint.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The outcome? The same people receive tons of similar link requests.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Once the threshold of around 50 emails is crossed (the number depends on each blogger's emotional stability), many of them start ignoring all the upcoming messages on the same subject, including yours.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          While the reality is becoming harsh on the link building arena, it's still too early to give up.

        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 italic">
          P.S. For convenience, I divided the guide based on the type of blogger outreach targets.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bloggers-who-link-to-content-on-your-target-topic" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">
          Bloggers who link to content on your target topic
        </h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>A short foreword.</strong> Bloggers who link to posts on your target topic, aka your competing pages, should go first on your list.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If they are fine with linking to a similar post, you have a fair chance of having that link replaced with yours.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Note that this contextual targeting will work only if your content is ten times better than someone else's. Learn how to create 10x content in our previous chapter.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To find such link prospects, check pages ranking for keywords related to your target topic in Google.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Let's say you've published a compilation of keyword tools.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Google a query like "<em>best keyword tools</em>" and switch to the top 100 results via settings.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Using a free web scraper, copy URLs of those pages and paste them into Google Sheets or Excel.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Next, see who links to each URL on your list with a backlink checker. This one shows 100 backlinks to a page for free. To see all of them, you'll need to go premium.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>What most folks do.</strong> Many people limit themselves here.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          They check link prospects for a very basic query ("<em>keyword tools</em>" in our case) and probably a few variations ("<em>best keyword tools</em>," "<em>free keyword tools</em>," "<em>keyword tools 2020</em>," etc).
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          While there's nothing wrong with such a tactic, that's what everyone does. Authors of articles ranking for those basic queries are bombarded with link requests like yours.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You'll have to face tougher competition.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-6">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>What you should do.</strong> Try to diversify the way you phrase your queries. It'll help you decrease the level of competition at this stage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Learn which keywords pages ranking for your basic query also rank for. For example, Ahrefs Keywords Explorer has a standalone report for this.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As shown above, pages ranking for "<em>keyword tools</em>" also rank for alternatives to Google Keyword Planner, Semrush, and other well-known tools.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Check out who links to pages ranking for those queries. Not only are they relevant for you, but also easier to approach due to fewer link requests they receive.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you don't have a tool at hand, you can use your logic.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In our example, keyword tools help users find people's search queries. If you follow the logic, keywords are equivalent to topics to write about.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          So, your link prospects could be bloggers linking to compilations of blog topic generators or, say, content idea generators.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In your email, tell bloggers that your tools let users find topic ideas with search traffic potential, not just those that sound good.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          Most likely, their readers will find them more helpful, especially if they're interested in driving more traffic to their blogs. And who isn't? ðŸ™‚

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>A short foreword.</strong> You and bloggers who cover your topics are pretty much on the same page.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          They are interested in the same stuff you are and should be curious to check out any related content.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Finding like-minded link prospects in Google is a moment's work.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you followed the previous step, you should already have them. I'm referring to pages that rank for your target keywords in Google, those you extracted via a web scraper.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>What most folks do.</strong> Many writers ask bloggers to check out their similar articles and never hear back from them.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          No wonder.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          While common interests can attract the attention of your topic allies, similar content can't.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When you reach out to authors of posts on your topic, you're trying to deal with your content competitors.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Not all of them will be responsive, especially if you don't give them a compelling reason to be.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">

            Find out what's missing in a competing post and make sure yours can fill the gap.

          Then, reach out and explain why your data could be a useful addition to the info already published.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          For example, almost no one makes a feature comparison. Hell yeah, it requires a huge investment of time to test each tool and gain such insights.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But don't regret spending time on unique content. Regret spending time on outreach that will bring you little to no backlinks.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you compare features of tools, you can offer bloggers to embed your comparison table with link attribution to your original.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Their readers will appreciate such a convenient way to compare items on their list.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          <strong>Note.</strong> Reach out to this category of link prospects only if you compete with them on the topic. If they are your direct competitors on the product, better stay away.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Let's stick to our example of building links to a compilation of keyword tools. In this case, your link prospects are authors of keyword research guides.

          What kind of keyword research can go without tools and their metrics?

          They usually don't go any further than running a search for obvious queries like "<em>keyword research guide</em>," "<em>how to find keywords</em>," etc.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>A short foreword.</strong> Competitors' backlink profiles are sources of information on any question:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>which of competitors' backlinks can bring them referral traffic;</li>

          <li>who links to them on an ongoing basis;</li>
          <li>where they submit guest posts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>What most folks do.</strong> Analyzing competitors' backlink profiles, many people try to imitate them way too close.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          They consider all of their competitors' referring domains to be their link prospects.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          For example, if someone's case study has many backlinks, people research the same topic and end up with similar findings.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But do link prospects need another study that proves what they already know?

          Another common failure is when people see competitors' backlinks from testimonials, they start offering their feedback too.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But unless they are big names in their niche, there's hardly anyone who'd be interested in testimonials from them.

          First of all, these are compilations of products like yours that don't link to you.

          If your product is a keyword tool, run a search for "best keyword tools" and click through results to see where you aren't on the list.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Next, ask bloggers who ignored you to check out your tool and give it a spin if they find it worthy.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To sound persuasive, you can analyze competitors' pricing and reach out under the excuse that your tool is more affordable than many others listed. That way, it will be a better option for startups and everyone else who sticks to a tight budget.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Make sure you provide free access for them if your product isn't free.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Compilations with monthly organic traffic are more valuable link prospects in this case.

          <strong>A short foreword.</strong> Guest blogs are basically the only link prospects that give you some control over the anchor text.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Does your backlink profile contain mostly branded and URL anchors? Then, do some guest posting to mix them with keyword anchors.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>What most folks do.</strong> Many guest post seekers use the same search strings to find guest blogs:
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 italic">
          keyword "write for us"<br />
          keyword "submit content"<br />
          keyword "guest post by"
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          And the list goes on.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The truth is blogs that have "write for us" pages receive multiple pitches daily.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Some of them have become so picky that they discard good pitches.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Others have come up with a more creative way of selection. They welcome only writers who won't mind paying them a "small publishing fee," which is nonsense if your content is good.
        </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
            <strong>What you should do.</strong> Take a look at guest blogging from a content angle â€“ it's not all about link building.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If you offer bloggers high-quality content for free, it's in their best interest to publish it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To accept your pitch, bloggers don't necessarily have to have a "write for us" page. Neither should they mark some of their articles as "guest posts."
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          And they do have a point.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Especially since Matt Cutts from Google said any backlink manipulations via guest blogging are forbidden.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The bottom line?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To find blogs potentially interested in your topic, google it without any search strings.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Next, check out if your target blog accepts guest contributions. Head to an author's bio to see if that person is an in-house writer or from an outside company.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Let's enter the first blog in the top 10 and click through its articles.

          Many of them are written by Buffer's staff, except for this one. Its author is Anum Hussain from a different company Acciyo.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          There's not a single mention on the page that it's a guest post, but it still is!
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          So, Buffer does accept guest posts, regardless of the fact that they don't have a "write for us' page.
        </p>

          <strong>A short foreword.</strong> Known as broken link building, this strategy is about helping both parties.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You'll earn new backlinks, while your link prospects will fix broken link issues on their domains.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Use a broken backlink checker to find competitors' dead pages that still have live backlinks.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>What most folks do.</strong> Dead pages exist not only on live domains. And that's what many people overlook in broken link building.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Over time, some companies grow into seven-figure businesses, while others go broke and shut down. Naturally, their domains with many content pages get expired. In this case, it's a good idea to use a domain scanner and check for any existing issues.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Bloggers don't keep an eye on every company they've ever mentioned. So, live backlinks to expired domains are still on their blogs.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-6">

          Note that expired domains relevant to your business won't always include your target keyword in their names.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>A short foreword.</strong> There are cases when you're much closer to gaining backlinks than you think.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These are sites with unlinked mentions of your business. By default, they'll give you privilege over others who will reach out to owners of those blogs.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You are not a complete stranger to those bloggers. They should have a good impression of your business if they decided to give it a mention.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Half the job is already done for you.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To find unlinked mentions, you can use Google and a bunch of advanced search operators:
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>intext:</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Use this operator to find pages containing your business name.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>â€“ (a minus sign)</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This operator will help you exclude pages from domains you don't need to check. These can be your site or sites, guest blogs you contribute to, or any other sites that make no sense for link building like social networks.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Since Google won't show you all the results found, make sure to exclude as many unnecessary domains as possible.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          For example, there are 11,900 results for OutreachMama, social networks excluded.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But you'll be able to check only 196 results.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you include omitted results, the number will grow to 319, but that's still not even a thousand.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Is it a dead end? No, you can filter results by different date ranges to extract more URLs, e.g. first for 2020, next for 2019, and so on.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>What most folks do.</strong> Many hunters for unlinked mentions check their company or domain names only and call it a day.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But that way, a lot of other business mentions drop off their radars.

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700">

        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Branded product names</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you give unique names to your products, check them for unlinked mentions.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          For example, Apple's branded product names are iPad, iPhone, Mac, Safari, iTunes, etc.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          The U.S. developer of website templates, TemplateMonster, brands their products with creative names too â€“ Woostroid, Apparelix, etc. You got the idea.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Mentions of team members</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When quoting someone, bloggers usually refer to the company's representatives rather than the company as a whole.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          That's why you should google mentions of your team members to see if they're all linked to your site.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Stolen visuals without link attribution</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The reason why people steal content is a mystery [sarcasm]. But the fact is they do, and visual content isn't an exception here.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Do a <a href="https://imagetotext.me/reverse-image-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">reverse image search</a> to check if someone has re-posted your pics and forgot to link to the original. Using professional reverse image search tools can make this process more efficient and comprehensive.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Right-click on your target image and then left-click on "Search Google for image."
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You can perform a search for any visuals, including custom featured images, research graphs and charts, infographics, logo designs, flyers, etc.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          This one is a favorite tactic for many blog outreach companies because its easy to find prospects and straightforward for landing links.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Links to social media profiles</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          At times, bloggers link to companies' social media posts and profiles instead of their websites directly.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Such links do give some exposure, but they are absolutely useless for growing website authority and search rankings along the way.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You can find such wasted link opportunities with a backlink checker you have at hand.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Enter URLs of your company's social media profiles and team members.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          For example, guys from Tribute Media link to OutreachMama's Twitter profile via a dofollow backlink. But there's no outreachmama.com among the domains tributemedia.com links to.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          Since tributemedia.com has a high DR of 72, it makes sense to redirect the currently wasted link juice to outreachmama.com.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Misspelled backlinks</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Lack of attention is quite common among bloggers, and some of them misspell domain names when linking out.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          While such incorrectly linked mentions are legally yours, link juice they send still doesn't reach its destination.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To find misspelled backlinks, generate possible typos of your domain name via this free tool.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Next, use your backlink checker to see if any of those misspelled domains have backlinks.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          For example, <em>fromthedogspaw.com</em> links to outreachmOma.com instead of its correct version outreachmAma.com via a dofollow backlink.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>A short foreword.</strong> In SEO circles, there's a rule to link out from every post to at least 3-4 relevant websites with high authority.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Such outbound links serve as trust signals and prove content relevance to search queries Google will rank it for.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In terms of link prospecting, you can use this scheme for your own good.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Each time you link out to bloggers, notify them about how useful their content turned out for yours that you referred to it.

          They will be thankful for such a nice gesture.

          Some prospects will link to you in return. Others will at least share your write-up with their social followers who can link to you in their turn.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>What most folks do.</strong> When writers need to link out somewhere, they randomly pick one of the first pages they see in Google search.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But the thing is another backlink won't do much good to those top-ranking pages.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Think about it. They already have what they want and got it without your help. You won't do them a big favor with another backlink, you see.

            Instead of linking out to posts that already feel good in the top 10, better target pages lagging behind. Look for them on the 2nd or 3rd pages of search results.

          Underperformers will appreciate your link much more than those in the top 10.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          That way, they'll be more willing to cooperate with you and pay you back with a backlink eventually.
        </p>

          <strong>Note.</strong> I'm not saying you should pick some untrustworthy domain with a zero or close-to-zero DR.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Google does dictate that we should link out to authority sites only. But such sites don't necessarily rank for all the keywords they target in the top 10.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          You'll find a lot of credible domains with a medium-to-high DR on the 2nd and 3rd pages of Google search.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Currently, pages ranking in the top 10 generate hundreds to thousands of monthly visitors from organic search. You can figure it out with a SERP checker like this.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To compare, many pages ranking in the top 11-20 don't get even a hundred visits per month.

          Help one of them rise above in SERP to get more traffic with your backlink.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Pages that have fewer referring domains</h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If a page has backlinks from 297 referring domains like #11 result, you won't impress its author with your 298th.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          With a ratio of 1 / 298, you understand how miserable the value you provide is, don't you?

          Instead, target pages with fewer backlinks like #12, #13 or even #15 with no referring domains. Your contribution will look more valuable in the eyes of such link prospects.

        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          It makes more sense to get 10 backlinks from 10 domains rather than from the same domain. That way, you'll receive link juice from 10 domains, not just one.
