      Blogger outreach has been the talk of the town for years.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      So many strategies have been shared and then reshared from every angle imaginable, illustrated with real-life examples, backed up by case studies, eased with templates, sped up with email automation tools…
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Today, when everything should be crystal clear, I'm still confused about some tactics suggested here and there. They either go against my logic or hold back some important details, making the whole point a bit vague.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Or maybe I should just retake an IQ test, lol.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      But am I the only one? Once in a while, I run into criticism of outreach emails. People post screenshots of erm… not so good unsolicited pitches or follow-ups to them. And then, as if on cue, their followers show up, and group shaming starts.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      You've probably seen it all too.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      To figure things out, I surveyed people about the major controversies happening at every stage of outreach.

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      After reading this post, you'll have more reasons to use some strategies and ditch others commonly known as "effective."

      Gurus say you'll succeed in blogger outreach using their tried and tested strategies. Just like they did years ago, and look where they're now.

      Their teachings inspire and help (no sarcasm here), but…

      I wonder why response rates are so low.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Studies show that less than 10% of recipients usually reply back. And response rates aren't even success rates – some people actually say no. Why is it so?

        I've been a blogger for many years, and I get dozens of outreach emails every month. They're all focused on link building and ask me to link to their product, article, infographic, or services.

        Those folks don't even look up who I am and what I do. I've had several companies, including someone working for UpWork, ask that I link to their logo design services from my blog. I am a logo designer. I wouldn't advertise competitors even if they paid me to, that's just dumb. They don't even check who they're messaging.

        Their offers to share one of my posts on their social media in exchange for a link? Despite supposedly having 10+ thousand followers, their posts get less than 5 likes on average and zero comments. This means their followers are bots, not real people. Some value exchange they're offering.

        I know what they want, and I know why they want it. And because I know how valuable links from reputable domains are, I find outreach requests just laughable.

      I hope you enjoyed going behind the scenes of blogger outreach reality.

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      As you can see, there's more thought to give to some strategies before blindly implementing them. Blogger outreach isn't math, and you can't do it by someone's proven formula. To understand how recipients see your pitch, always put yourself in their shoes. Would you accept your own offer?
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      No?
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Then, it's quite naive to expect that someone else will. Don't underestimate your prospects – they aren't fools.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      Drawing conclusions from a single opinion seems a bit questionable. That's why I'm gonna collect some stats on the most controversial questions and update this post soon, so stay tuned.
