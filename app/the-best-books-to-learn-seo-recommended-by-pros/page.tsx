        <h2 id="top-books-on-search-engine-optimization">Top Books on Search Engine Optimization</h2>

        <p>Read the greatest books about SEO, with all its secrets and pitfalls. They have become the most important sources of knowledge for business leaders, founders, and managers who used them as guideposts in optimizing their websites for search engines.</p>

        <h2 id="seo-for-beginners">SEO for Beginners</h2>

        <p>Subtitle: Learn the basics of SEO in under 3 hours!
Author: Mark Northwell
Number of pages: 99</p>

        <h4>What it covers</h4>

        <p>Are you a newcomer to the world of search engine optimization?
Then this beginner’s guide to SEO is the first book to ease you into it.
The author makes it clear why everyone optimizes for search engines today, how your site operates, or what “creatures” crawl your web pages and index them without you even noticing it. He also provides a complete list of keyword research tools that become handy to anyone trying to SEO their way to success.
And that is not all. You’ll get more SEO fundamentals.
99 pages divided by three hours = 33 pages per hour. What do you think? Can you manage it?</p>

        <h4>Whose recommendation is it?</h4>

        <p>Jerry Han, CMO at PrizeRebel:
“I say, always start with the basics. And this SEO book can help you do that. It explains why SEO challenges you first but then lets you reap the rewards. More importantly, it teaches you the essentials to help you put your foot on the grounds of the SEO kingdom.
What I liked the best – Mark Northwell doesn’t overwhelm you with technical details or complicated terms. He walks you through a simple and highly understandable guide.”</p>

        <h2 id="3-months-to-no-1">3 Months to No.1</h2>

        <p>Subtitle: The “No-Nonsense” SEO Playbook for Getting Your Website Found on Google
Author: Will Coombe
Number of pages: 247</p>

        <h4>What it covers</h4>

        <p>Imagine you’re giving someone your brand-new website and asking them to bring you the first page results on Google in just three months.
This someone is Will Coombe, and in this book on SEO, he demonstrates how he’d do this for you.
By erecting the four pillars of SEO, of course:
• Pillar #1. Relevance
• Pillar #2. Crawlability
• Pillar #3. Engagement
• Pillar #4. Authority
Under his guidance, you’ll learn how to find relevant target keywords, make it easy for Google to inspect your pages, boost user engagement, increase domain authority, and more.</p>

        <h4>Whose recommendation is it?</h4>

        <p>Jesse Hanson, Content Manager at Online Solitaire and Word of Card Games:
“SEO always seemed a complicated game for my understanding because I didn’t know its basic rules. Until I learned those from Will Coombe, a co-founder of the UK’s leading SEO agency, in this playbook.
The major revelation, however, was that nobody truly knows how to game Google. And it’s more like a cat-and-mouse game between this search engine and SEO pros. There are no super-fast hacks, but there’s hard work and certain steps to be taken.”</p>

        <h2 id="seo-help">SEO Help</h2>

        <p>Subtitle: 20 Practical Steps to Power Your Content Creation, Marketing and Branding in the New AI World of Google Search
Author: David Amerland
Number of pages: 198</p>

        <h4>What it covers</h4>

        <p>In SEO Help, David Amerland talks about 20 SEO aspects you should know and apply in practice. For example, voice search, structured data, YouTube SEO, podcasting, hashtagging, etc.
In one of the chapters, he particularly outlines the role of AI in SEO and the perspectives it opens in front of businesses. He establishes the connection between artificial intelligence and semantic search and names the 4Vs of big data:
• Volume
• Variety
• Velocity
• Veracity
Remarkably, all chapters end with action checklists.</p>

        <h4>Whose recommendation is it?</h4>

        <p>Jesse Galanis, Content Manager at Tech Lockdown:
“My top pick among the best books for learning SEO is the fourth edition of SEO Help published in 2020. The first edition came out in 2010. Since then, SEO has changed a lot. That’s why the author updated this release and added tons of fresh content to it.
Interestingly, every chapter is like a standalone book describing a specific SEO topic. You shouldn’t necessarily read chapters one by one. You can skip those you don’t need and move to the part that kindles your interest most.”</p>

        <h2 id="link-building-is-dead">Link Building Is Dead</h2>

        <p>Subtitle: Long Live Link Building!
Author: Sage Lewis
Number of pages: 216</p>

        <h4>What it covers</h4>

        <p>So, link building is dead, right?
So wrong.
Would you like to see that it’s actually more than alive?
Sage Lewis proves that by examples and case studies of Walmart, Catster & Dogster, and others. Obama’s link-building strategy, for instance, fueled his victory in the elections. You can also get easy backlinks just like other companies did. See how exactly in the book.
Besides, the author doesn’t let you forget about a social media link-building strategy you might need to develop right now to win the competition.</p>

        <h4>Whose recommendation is it?</h4>

        <p>Fernando Lopez, Marketing Director at Circuit:
“It’s one of the must-read SEO books on link building and its peculiarities. It makes you rethink your approach to getting backlinks. A link builder should be a PR professional, in the first place, not a spammer. That’s the key lesson I learned from this book.”</p>

        <h2 id="seo-workbook">SEO Workbook</h2>

        <p>Subtitle: Search Engine Optimization Success in Seven Steps
Author: Jason McDonald
Number of pages: 360</p>

        <h4>What it covers</h4>

        <p>SEO is power. SEO is mysterious. SEO seems impossible.
And yet, Jason McDonald believes anyone can master this craft. How? By following these steps:
• Step 1. Work out your SEO mindset and set goals
• Step 2. Create a keyword worksheet
• Step 3. Get your site to speak “the Google language”
• Step 4. Develop a content SEO strategy
• Step 5. Do off-page SEO and boost your social authority
• Step 6. Measure your progress
• Step 7. Practice all the time (worksheets + tools)
To make it all possible, you might need to create a dedicated team of managers, marketers, content writers, web designers, programmers, and outreach experts for your SEO project.</p>

        <h4>Whose recommendation is it?</h4>

        <p>Alex Milligan, Co-founder & CMO of NuggMD:
“Jason McDonald has become my coach in search engine optimization. His SEO workout book has taught me how to optimize effectively to get any website in an SEO-healthy shape. I like the comparison he uses in this guidebook. SEO is like physical fitness which requires discipline and smart work, not hard work.”</p>

The author names four ways to rank on the first page of Google for free:
