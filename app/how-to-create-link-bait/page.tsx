          For years, bloggers have been bombarded with emails that had pretty much the same outreach excuse.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mb-6">
          "I see you linked to that post, and I've written a similar one, so feel free to link to it." Â© every other outreach specialist
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I bet it sounds familiar to you too if your site has been live for more than a year. ðŸ™‚
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Due to full inboxes of spammy emails, having a similar post isn't the outreach excuse bloggers will react to today.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          On a good day, they will just ignore your letter and forget about it. In the worst case, they will get annoyed and blacklist you. This will close the door to your possible collaborations with them in the future.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Since your goal is to build bridges rather than burn them, there must be a solid excuse to reach out to bloggers.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Instead of the "check-my-similar-post" cliche, you need much better or completely different content.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          That's what digital marketing influencers advocate, particularly Rand Fishkin with his 10x content notion and Brian Dean with his skyscraper technique.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Others have termed it "linkbait". I personally prefer the term "linkable asset."
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          So, what's the best way to come up with ideas for 10x content? Put yourself in the searcher's shoes and find weak points that posts on your target topic have.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Let me guide you through the whole process on the example of the topic "keyword research tools."
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          P.S. I won't deny that the whole process of creating outreach-worthy link bait is time-consuming. If you're pressed for time, you can always delegate content creation to professionals. For example, if you're based in London like me, check out this list of content marketing agencies.

                Not sure about you but I'm quite picky as a searcher. Before making a final choice, I check out many offers available to make sure I don't miss anything cool. I want the best possible solution for my money.

              <p className="text-gray-700">

                Some bloggers describe keyword tools in a way that sounds like a re-written copy of their official product pages. Others talk only about their favorite features, but it's still unclear if the features I need are there.

                With its help, searchers will have a clear picture of what each product has and lacks. That way, they'll be able to skip irrelevant stuff and focus on what matters only.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                You can go the extra mile for people on a tight budget and create one more table with freebies only. It can include both totally free tools and premium products with free plans for starters.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                But if those 25 keywords have miserable search volumes, they provide little to no value. And this numerical superiority of tool B is just a PR stunt.
