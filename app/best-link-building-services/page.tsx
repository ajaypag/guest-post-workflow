                  While many SEO companies will focus on guest blogging, they've worked hard to build countless direct relationships with marquee publishers so that the majority of their content placements appear fully organic (without sponsored tags or guest post attribution). Their editorial link building strategy allows them to attract links that send the most topically relevant link juice from these publishers to your domain, pushing you higher in the rankings and increasing traffic to your site.

                  Breeeze has been hired by inBeat, its sibling company. If you didn't know this, inBeat is an influencer marketing platform that used to have just 500 visitors per month. Breeeze increased that number to 70,000 visitors per month, adding $4,000,000 in pipeline value.

                  Breeeze's link-building tactics are centered on two pillars: Google's guidelines and sustainable SEO.
                  That's why they can promise long-term results.
                  But Breeeze adapts its tactics according to each customer. For example, they can use HARO, relationship-based link-building, identifying low-hanging fruit keywords, and more. For their inBeat sibling, they also focused on building multiple free tools with high-traffic potential.

                  Breeeze's pricing policy is straightforward: $400 flat-fee link pricing. However, they clearly state you "pay for what you get." So, you'll have to book that meeting with David Morneau to find out exactly what you can expect to get.

                  They call their second service Authority Links Placements, but it is essentially the same thing, with a higher Domain Authority. A link like that would cost you anywhere from $400 to $600.
                  Their final service is access to their database of inclusion opportunities. For only $9.99/month you can see each site Loganix has previously worked with that is up for receiving guest posts.
                  However, publishing on those resources isn't free (of course) and you will have to pay anywhere from a couple hundred up to thousands of dollars depending on the URL chosen.

                  Desire Marketing is an affordable link building company that offers customized and targeted services.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                  With over 5 years of experience, they've created a large catalog of 9K blogs in almost every niche to gain links from. Whenever their clients need links from blogs that aren't in their database, they do outreach based on those requirements.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Their primary goal is to develop a brand-specific strategy to build contextually relevant links for each website. Such links send signals of authority to Google, Bing, and other search engines to rank them higher.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                  Desire Marketing specialists use three ways to build links – guest posting, blogger outreach, and niche edits.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                  To do guest posting, they interact with influential bloggers and contribute high-quality content with clients' links to their blogs. Or they can order blog owners to write an article themselves. That way, the link will appear on behalf of the site admin rather than a guest writer.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  The tactic of niche edits is less time-consuming, as there's no need to write an entire article for the sake of a single backlink. Instead, outreach specialists ask bloggers to insert their client's link into an already published post.

They do an SEO audit of their client's website and provide a detailed estimate of how many links they'll need and how much that will cost.

                  The HOTH GuestPost package has a name that speaks for itself. It is your standard guest posting offer with pricings depending on the DA of the site linking to you, starting at $100/link from a DA 10+ resource up to $500/link for a 50+ DA site.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                  The difference between the regular and the PRO version of the HOTH GuestPost lies in how the prospects are chosen. In the PRO package, instead of looking at a site's DA, the team looks at how much monthly organic traffic a resource is getting.
                  A link from a site with a thousand organic visitors will cost you $200, and if you'd like to go for bigger resources with up to 25,000 organic traffic the price will go up to $500. Sure, this service is a little bit more expensive, but organic traffic is also a more accurate representation of a site's well-being than its Domain Authority.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                  Next up is the HOTH Foundations. To sum up how it works: firstly, the team sets up mini-authority properties on blogging platforms, where contextual links back to your site are placed in original, semantically relevant content. Of course, you have complete control over your anchor text.
                  The prices for this package range anywhere from $60 to $500 depending on the number of URLs, blogs, and whether you're looking for regular or premium content.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                  You will find the HOTH Blitz offer interesting if you're looking to quickly boost your secondary resource. The team has a lot of connections with websites from practically every niche out there. And this offer secures permanent backlinks in the homepage sidebars of those sites.
                  You can get 5 such links for as little as $250, 10 for $450, and 20 for $875.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Last but not least is the HOTH Boost. This offer gets you in-content links on high-DA resources to, once again, boost your secondary properties, social media posts, videos, etc.
                  It is also the cheapest, with two pricing choices: $49 and $149 for 50 and 250 posts respectively.
                  The HOTH offers a pretty impressive range of services which you will surely find helpful.
