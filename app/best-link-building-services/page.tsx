                  While many SEO companies will focus on guest blogging, they've worked hard to build countless direct relationships with marquee publishers so that the majority of their content placements appear fully organic (without sponsored tags or guest post attribution). Their editorial link building strategy allows them to attract links that send the most topically relevant link juice from these publishers to your domain, pushing you higher in the rankings and increasing traffic to your site.

                  Breeeze has been hired by inBeat, its sibling company. If you didn't know this, inBeat is an influencer marketing platform that used to have just 500 visitors per month. Breeeze increased that number to 70,000 visitors per month, adding $4,000,000 in pipeline value.

                  Breeeze's link-building tactics are centered on two pillars: Google's guidelines and sustainable SEO.
                  That's why they can promise long-term results.
                  But Breeeze adapts its tactics according to each customer. For example, they can use HARO, relationship-based link-building, identifying low-hanging fruit keywords, and more. For their inBeat sibling, they also focused on building multiple free tools with high-traffic potential.

                  Breeeze's pricing policy is straightforward: $400 flat-fee link pricing. However, they clearly state you "pay for what you get." So, you'll have to book that meeting with David Morneau to find out exactly what you can expect to get.

                  They call their second service Authority Links Placements, but it is essentially the same thing, with a higher Domain Authority. A link like that would cost you anywhere from $400 to $600.
                  Their final service is access to their database of inclusion opportunities. For only $9.99/month you can see each site Loganix has previously worked with that is up for receiving guest posts.
                  However, publishing on those resources isn't free (of course) and you will have to pay anywhere from a couple hundred up to thousands of dollars depending on the URL chosen.
