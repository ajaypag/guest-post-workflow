        <h2 id="what-are-easy-backlinks-">What are easy backlinks?</h2>

        <p>Easy backlinks are links from other websites to your own that can be obtained with little effort. These types of backlinks can be contrasted with “difficult” backlinks, which may require more time, resources, or effort to get.
Easy backlinks can be a valuable part of an overall link-building strategy because they can help improve the search engine ranking of a website and drive more traffic to it. There are several ways to get easy backlinks, like participating in online communities or forums and using social media to promote your website. In fact, you can even use a social media scheduler to ease the process.
It’s important to note, however, that while easy backlinks can be a useful part of a link-building strategy, they should not be the only source of backlinks for a website. It’s important to focus on obtaining high-quality, authoritative backlinks as well.</p>

        <h2 id="why-is-it-important-to-get-backlinks-">Why is it important to get backlinks?</h2>

        <p>Backlinks are a critical factor in search engine optimization (SEO) because they show the popularity and authority of a website.
When other websites link to your site, it shows search engines that your content is valuable and relevant. This can help improve your search engine ranking and drive more traffic to your site.
Here are a few specific reasons it’s important to get backlinks:Improved search engine ranking: As mentioned, backlinks can help improve your website’s domain authority. When search engines see other reputable websites link to your website, they may consider it more relevant and trustworthy, which can lead to a higher ranking in search results.
• Increased referral traffic: Besides improving your search engine ranking, backlinks can also drive more targeted traffic to your website.

        <h2 id="7-simple-strategies-to-get-easy-backlinks">7 simple strategies to get easy backlinks</h2>

        <p>Did you know 65% of marketers believe building backlinks is the most difficult part of SEO? To ease the process, here are the simplest ways to target easy backlinks:</p>

        <h2 id="1-become-a-source-for-journalists-and-bloggers">1. Become a source for journalists and bloggers</h2>

        <p>Have you mostly struggled with getting backlinks from high-quality, authoritative websites?
One way to do this is by becoming a source for journalists and bloggers on platforms like Help A Reporter Out (HARO) and Help A B2B Writer. These platforms connect those who make living as writers and journalists with experts in various fields who can provide quotes, insights, and information for their articles. All you have to do is sign up and start responding to queries from writers.
While this may not be the easiest way to build backlinks, it can be a highly effective strategy for getting backlinks from reputable sources. By providing valuable information and insights to writers, you can increase your chances of being quoted or mentioned in their articles. This can not only give you a backlink but also help position you as an authority in your field.
However, it’s important to note that there are no guarantees for getting backlinks from these platforms. Writers may not always use your quote, and you will need to give a detailed response to increase your chances of being mentioned.
But if you’re willing to put in the effort, becoming a source on platforms like HARO and Help A B2B Writer can be a valuable way to get backlinks and increase your visibility.</p>

        <h2 id="2-join-forums-and-communities">2. Join forums and communities</h2>

        <p>Joining forums and online communities in your niche can be a great way to get backlinks from meaningful websites related to your industry. By participating in these communities, you can establish yourself as an authority in your field and get backlinks from other members of the community. You can also use tools to engage with the members of various platforms and communities, and you may implement a LinkedIn email finder to connect with link-building prospects.
However, it’s important to make sure you’re joining high-quality forums and communities. These types of channels are more likely to have other members who are interested in your content and willing to share it and link to it. This can help you get better-quality backlinks from peers in your industry and increase website conversions.
To get the most out of these communities, be sure to actively take part in discussions and offer valuable insights and information. By doing so, you can build relationships with other members and increase the chances of getting backlinks. Additionally, consider contributing content to the forum or community, such as blog posts or articles, which can also help you get backlinks.</p>

        <h2 id="3-fix-broken-links">3. Fix Broken Links</h2>

        <p>Fixing broken links can be an easy and effective way to build backlinks for your website. A broken link is a hyperlink that leads to a webpage that no longer exists or has moved to a new location. These types of links can be frustrating for users and can also harm the search engine ranking of a website.
By fixing broken links on your website, you can improve the user experience for visitors and help ensure that your website is functioning properly. This can be a simple task that can be done using a tool like the W3C Link Checker or by manually checking your website for broken links. A free source for checking broken links is Ahrefs.
But fixing broken links can also be a way to build backlinks for your website. When you come across a broken link on another website, you can reach out to the website owner and offer to help fix it. By providing a working link to your website as a replacement, you can potentially get a backlink in return.</p>

        <h2 id="4-update-old-content">4. Update old content</h2>

        <p>If there’s one content marketing trend that never goes out of style, it’s refreshing old content. Doing so can be a great way to target easy backlinks. When you update and refresh old content, you can make it more valuable and relevant to your audience, which can make it more attractive to other websites and bloggers. By updating old content, you can also improve its search engine ranking, which can help drive more traffic to your site.
There are several ways you can update old content to target easy backlinks. One way is to simply add new information or insights to the content. By doing this, you can make it more comprehensive and valuable to readers, which can make it more attractive to other websites and bloggers looking for high-quality content to link to.
Another way to update old content is to refresh the design or format of the content. By giving old content a new look and feel, you can make it more appealing to readers. You can paraphrase certain phrases and paragraphs if needed to make the content more compelling.
Either you manually do it or get help from the paraphrasing tool that automatically does it for you. This can be especially effective for content that may have become outdated or less visually appealing over time.</p>

        <h2 id="5-create-infographics">5. Create infographics</h2>

        <p>Creating infographics or other informative images can be a great way to get backlinks every time the asset you created is used. Infographics are visual representations of information that can explain complex concepts or data in an easy-to-understand format. These types of assets can be highly shareable and can often be used by other websites and bloggers as a source of information.
When you create an infographic or other informative image, you can include a link to your website in the credits or the embed code. This can help ensure that you get a backlink every time the asset is used by someone else.
To increase the chances of your infographics or informative images being used and shared, create high-quality assets that are informative and visually appealing. Enhance image quality to ensure crisp details and vibrant colors, making your visuals more attractive and professional. Doing so can increase the likelihood that others will want to use your assets and link to your website and the graphic design cost is not so high.</p>

        <h2 id="6-promote-your-linkable-assets">6. Promote your linkable assets</h2>

        <p>In addition to visual assets like infographics, you can also create other types of linkable assets to get backlinks. Linkable assets are pieces of content that are valuable, informative, and shareable, and that other websites and bloggers can use as a source of information. These types of assets can include things like ebooks, whitepapers, checklists, PowerPoint templates, and more.
Creating linkable assets can be a one-time investment, but it can help you get multiple backlinks when the content is distributed and promoted properly. By creating valuable, informative content that others will want to use and share, you can increase the chances that your assets will be linked to by other websites and bloggers.
To get the most out of your linkable assets, be sure to promote them effectively. This can include sharing them on social media, promoting them on your website, and reaching out to other websites and bloggers who may be interested in using them. By doing this, you can increase the visibility of your assets and increase the chances that you’ll get backlinks.</p>

        <h2 id="7-give-testimonials">7. Give testimonials</h2>

        <p>Giving testimonials can be a great way to get backlinks from the websites of the companies or individuals you’re recommending. Why? Because when you provide a testimonial, you’re essentially vouching for the quality of a product or service and encouraging others to try it.
In return, the company may include a link to your website in its testimonials section as a way of thanking you for your endorsement.
But here’s the thing: to be effective, your testimonials need to be high-quality and not just generic phrases like “amazing product” or “great service.” The best testimonials are specific and detailed, describing the specific benefits and features of the product or service and how it has helped you.
This type of testimonial is more likely to be included on the company’s website and to convince others to try the product or service. So, if you want to get backlinks from giving testimonials, put some thought into your endorsements.
Take the time to write detailed, specific testimonials that showcase the benefits and value of the products or services you’re recommending. By doing so, you’ll increase your chances of getting backlinks and helping others discover great products and services that can benefit them as well.
Also, with platforms like Testimonial.to, giving your testimonials is super easy.</p>
