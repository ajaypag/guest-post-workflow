        What a turn of events!
      </p>

      <p>
        As you've landed on this page, you are just one book away from mastering SEO.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you don't believe me, read reviews of those who have learned search engine optimization with the below-listed SEO books.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seriously, you are facing eight "doors" once opened by business professionals. They can lead you from A to Z of search engine optimization: from SEO definitions and fundamentals to some senior-class tactics on how to optimize for conversions and little-known secrets of SEO.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take out your magic wand and repeat after me: Revelio.
      </p>

      <p>
        (Now, I am kidding. Just a huge Harry Potter fan)
      </p>

      <p>
        So, to the list!
      </p>

      <h2>Top Books on Search Engine Optimization</h2>

      <p>
        Read the greatest books about SEO, with all its secrets and pitfalls. They have become the most important sources of knowledge for business leaders, founders, and managers who used them as guideposts in optimizing their websites for search engines.
      </p>

        Then this beginner's guide to SEO is the first book to ease you into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The author makes it clear why everyone optimizes for search engines today, how your site operates, or what "creatures" crawl your web pages and index them without you even noticing it.

      </p>

      <p>
        And that is not all. You'll get more SEO fundamentals.

      <h2>3 Months to No.1</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Subtitle:</strong> The "No-Nonsense" SEO Playbook for Getting Your Website Found on Google<br />
        <strong>Author:</strong> Will Coombe<br />
        <strong>Number of pages:</strong> 247
      </p>

      <h3>What it covers</h3>

      <p>
        Imagine you're giving someone your brand-new website and asking them to bring you the first page results on Google in just three months.
      </p>

      <p>
        This someone is Will Coombe, and in this book on SEO, he demonstrates how he'd do this for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        By erecting the four pillars of SEO, of course:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pillar #1. Relevance</li>
        <li>Pillar #2. Crawlability</li>
        <li>Pillar #3. Engagement</li>
        <li>Pillar #4. Authority</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Under his guidance, you'll learn how to find relevant target keywords, make it easy for Google to inspect your pages, boost user engagement, increase domain authority, and more.
      </p>

          "SEO always seemed a complicated game for my understanding because I didn't know its basic rules. Until I learned those from Will Coombe, a co-founder of the UK's leading SEO agency, in this playbook.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major revelation, however, was that nobody truly knows how to game Google. And it's more like a cat-and-mouse game between this search engine and SEO pros. There are no super-fast hacks, but there's hard work and certain steps to be taken."

        <strong>Author:</strong> David Amerland<br />
        <strong>Number of pages:</strong> 198
      </p>

      <h3>What it covers</h3>

      <p>
        In SEO Help, David Amerland talks about 20 SEO aspects you should know and apply in practice. For example, voice search, structured data, YouTube SEO, podcasting, hashtagging, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        In one of the chapters, he particularly outlines the role of AI in SEO and the perspectives it opens in front of businesses. He establishes the connection between artificial intelligence and semantic search and names the 4Vs of big data:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Volume</li>
        <li>Variety</li>
        <li>Velocity</li>
        <li>Veracity</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Remarkably, all chapters end with action checklists.

        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, every chapter is like a standalone book describing a specific SEO topic. You shouldn't necessarily read chapters one by one. You can skip those you don't need and move to the part that kindles your interest most."

        So, link building is dead, right?

      <p>
        So wrong.

      <p>
        Would you like to see that it's actually more than alive?
      </p>

      <p>
        Sage Lewis proves that by examples and case studies of Walmart, Catster & Dogster, and others. Obama's link-building strategy, for instance, fueled his victory in the elections. You can also get easy backlinks just like other companies did. See how exactly in the book.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides, the author doesn't let you forget about a social media link-building strategy you might need to develop right now to win the competition.
