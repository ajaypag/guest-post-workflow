        <p>## Hunter</p>

        <p>### General Features</p>

        <p>With over 100 million emails indexed, it was claimed that Hunter is the most powerful email-finding tool ever created! It will find the email addresses of people either individually or in bulk. It is a Cloud-based email search solution that helps businesses find emails on company websites, verify domains, compose follow-ups, and more.
Hunter Email Finder uses the most complete database of public email addresses to find the right contact information and everything goes to verification first before being returned to the searcher. Email addresses with a green shield passed its verification and so the searcher can use them safely.
If the email addresses cannot be validated, Hunter will provide a confidence score on the returned email to help and guide the user on how sure and accurate the email address is.</p>

        <h3 id="how-much-will-it-cost-you-">How much will it cost you?</h3>

        <p>There is a free version of Hunter that gives its users 25 searches/month with limited access. The good thing about it is, a search is only counted if you get results. You will also get 50 verifications for free each month.
The paid version has 4 tiers and will give users full access to the product. It can be billed either monthly or annually (with a 30% discount)
• Starter
• Growth
• Pro
• Enterprise
Starter Tier is priced at $49/mo if billed monthly and $34/mo if on yearly billing. This gives the customer 500 searches and 1000 verifications per month.
Growth Tier is priced at $99/mo on monthly billing and $69/mo if billed yearly. It provides the user with 2500 searches and 500 verifications per month.
Pro Tier will cost $199/mo if billed monthly and $139/mo for yearly billing. This will give the user 10000 searches and 20000 verifications each month.
Enterprise Tier is priced at $399/mo on monthly billing and $279/mo with yearly billing. It will also allow the customer to have 30000 searches and 60000 verifications per month.
Unlike other products, there are no Extended or Plus versions for each tier. You have to upgrade to the next tier if the need arises. It will cost you double the price but on the positive side, it will give you double the value of the searches and verifications.</p>

        <h3 id="what-makes-you-like-it-">What makes you like it?</h3>

        <p>The free version is really good! Many Hunter users have never really paid or upgraded to the paid version. The free searches and verifications are sufficient especially if you are not a heavy user of the email finder.
The interface is very easy and simple to use even for a non-techy person. Of course, there are better ones in the market, but you will also have to shell out some dollars for that.
The great thing about Hunter is that you can click the extension and it’ll even have their titles with their emails and phone number. Other products will charge you for the phone numbers separately (i.e SignalHire).
Hunter email verification does an excellent job of filtering out anything that is going to bounce. This greatly helps in protecting the integrity of the domain you are using in sending the emails from.
You will Hunter easier to use with Gmail integrated features to keep everything synced and an amazing email campaign tool for sending bulk emails.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>As mentioned, the free version of Hunter works very well. In this sense, it can be prone to abuse in sending spam marketing and email communication.
Another aspect is the pricing. There is no PLUS or expandable version for each price tier. If your need fluctuates, you have to cancel your current tier and buy the next tier or the lower tier. Also, the paid plan starts on a higher-end which makes it a pricey option if opting for the paid plan.
Email verifications need improvement, based on user feedback. Sometimes it isn’t able to confirm the email verification or create false positives. So if you’re using it, be cautious and make sure to double-check the results before sending email to the recipients.
It doesn’t work with Linkedin and other Social Media applications.</p>

Many users commented that their CS Support is great, replying immediately to queries while providing immediate resolution to customer difficulties!
Their integration with LinkedIn, Hubspot and Salesforce draws most of their customers to subscribe to Apollo as it is very efficient, accurate and reliable.
Another feature that you will like about Apollo is the 14-day trial period, in their paid versions. Most other email finders will offer you the trial period in their most basic or in their free-trial version which is very limited in benefits and access.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>Just remember that Apollo charges you per user. So, say, your boss just wants to log in to view your activity or to check and track your progress, you have to purchase him a separate subscription.
The tool can be quite slow at times when navigating from one window to another.  Some of the contact numbers and even emails are not updated.
While the general feedback is about great UI, the dashboard is quite intimidating especially for new users and beginners, with some commenting on higher learning curve in using the application.</p>

You can use it to find and prospect emails from social networks like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter. It can also be used as a bulk email finder where you can search email addresses from a list of names and companies or domains.

        <h3 id="how-much-will-it-cost-you-">How much will it cost you?</h3>

        <p>Here’s the thing, NO YEARLY PLANS! As the powers-that-be at Find That Email believes that users should be able to cancel their subscription whenever they want.
There are 5 options for users to choose from:
The FreeTrial, Starter, Pro, Teams, and Custom.
Charges are the same across the board, however, the number of credits may vary, as clients can choose whether to buy the BUNDLE Plan, FIND Plans, OR VERIFY Plans. That’s right, they charge and allocate Find credits and Verify credits SEPARATELY.
Let’s examine the Bundle Plan.</p>

        <p>For the Free Trial, the user needs to sign up and will be given 100 Verify credits and 50 Find credits per month, with very limited access.
The Starter costs $29/month and will provide the user with 750 Verify Credits and 250 Find Credits.

The Pro is priced at $79/month with 5,000 Verify Credits and 1,000 Find Credits. It has all the perks of the Starter plan and the additional benefit of transferring credits as it will allow you to create 2 users.
Teams will cost $149/month and will allow Unlimited users and transferable credits. Clients will enjoy 15,000 Verify Credits and 3,000 Find Credits while having all of the benefits including API Access.
For the Custom, the cost will range from $249 to $2499 per month, with 25,000 Verify credits and 5,000 Find credits to 500,000 Verify credits and 100,000 Find credits per month, respectively. You can choose the option by yourself without contacting its Sales Dept as it can be done on their website itself.
As mentioned, the charges in all plans stay the same. However, the credits will change.
In Find Plans, the Starter is 500 find credits, the Pro is 2,000 Find credits and Teams have 6,000 creditsIn Verify Plans, the Starter option will allocate the user with 1,500 Verify credits, Pro will have 10,000 Verify credits and the Teams option will have 30,000 Verify credits.

        <p>Most of the feedback from users mentioned that its email scraping was top notch and 90% of the time delivered valid email addresses. Customer support is very fast, their email verification tool is very accurate.
Find That Email gives a confidence score and gives its users an idea if the email address is accurate and if it can impact their email bounce rate. A lot of the companies deduct credits for searching while Find That Email ONLY deducts a credit when an email address is found and that is cool! They also offer a 14 days money-back no-questions-asked guarantee to new subscribers.
Customer support also is highly rated by the users, with a prompt response and easy to contact as primary reasons.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>Some users’ experience searching using LinkedIn Chrome extension is very slow compared to other tools.  Some competitors have a lower price per contact when compared. However, its high accuracy rate and overall efficiency compensate for it.
The free trial doesn’t allow the user to try out all the options available within the paid plans. It would have been great if the free trial would grant this access so that new subscribers can actually “get the feel” of the application. As a would-be user, you would like to have a chance to test out all the features before you decide to upgrade your account to the paid version, right?</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>LeadGibbons’ accuracy is NOT as high as some of the more expensive competitors in the market, but it is better than the other cheaper Chrome extension tools out there! Some reviews mentioned that it is a bit on the expensive side compared to other solutions in this category.

Also, customer support is nice and efficient and replies within minutes.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>Pricing can be improved and data accuracy which is claimed to be 100 percent accurate, needs some substantial change.
It takes time for bulk search but future updates might improve the performance. The phone numbers are sometimes corporate phone numbers of the company and not the office desk phone numbers of that prospect.</p>

        <h3 id="what-makes-you-like-it-">What makes you like it?</h3>

        <p>If you want to find emails on LinkedIn or Instagram, this tool works great. Although accuracy is not that best, it is still good and reliable enough when compared to other options in the market.
The Chrome Extension is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. Pricing is more competitive as it is on the more affordable side. It also generates more than one email which gives you more alternatives and information.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>Make sure that you keep track of your credits, as the credits don’t roll over if you do not use them. It does not provide live support, like chat or call. Customer service needs improvement in this case as the only way to reach them is by email and replies might take some time.
Data accuracy as well needs to improve, as there are comments from users regarding the inaccuracy of data as it gives them out-of-date emails or emails that don’t work anymore, although overall experience seems to be good.
There seems to be a lot of complaints regarding the free credits provided as insufficient as Kendo only provides 50 credits per month for its free plan version.</p>

• Enrich, leads with powerful data points where you can add filters or parameters of what you are searching

When you want to Verify email, another pricing scheme is available. It is on a Pay-as-you-go basis. Only $.003/email up to 500k and $.001/email above that. You just need to type in the number of emails you want to verify and it will provide you the amount that you need you pay.

VoilaNorbert provides a one-time 50 credits for free. After that, you have to subscribe to any of the plans or buy a Prepaid plan to continue using its services.</p>

        <h3 id="what-makes-you-like-it-">What makes you like it?</h3>

        <p>It is the only platform that doesn’t require a subscription and offers its users a prepaid option which is great if you are not a heavy user of the tool.  You only have to purchase credits depending on your need at a time.
The accuracy is pretty good compared to other tools in the market and it has a clean user interface. Accuracy may be this software’s strong point. You get quality.
Users also appreciated the organization of the searched list and the general ease of usage of the tool. The software requires very little setup and provides great value for the task it is designed for. The browser extension facilitates usage greatly.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>Pricing. Not that it is the most expensive, but users have to pay extra for email verification and “enrichment”. These features are already incorporated in the pricing of other tools in the market.
Typical of any email finders in the market, accuracy still needs improvement as sometimes email addresses found were obsolete. But still, this one is at par, if not above the accuracy rate of its competitors.</p>

        <h2 id="finder-expert">Finder.Expert</h2>

        <p>### General Features</p>

        <p>Finder.Expert is a tool that finds emails of prospects and companies. It has a chrome extension for ease of use and access. Find only verified prospects by domain or using LinkedIn and Twitter data and you can keep contacts in one place.

        <h3 id="what-makes-you-like-it-">What makes you like it?</h3>

        <p>If anything, you might like the fact that they use proofy.io to verify emails for free. It is a reliable app by itself, so expect to have some good, quality emails.
Price is also on the affordable side and the free credit they offer is insanely huge compare to most email finders out there!</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>I found out that its other name is Contact Finder (Source: G2.com). It seems that the chrome extension has only 3000+ users. No wonder, there are not many reviews and buzz of this tool on the internet.
Their webpage needs a revamp. It looks lazy and dry with not much “umpph” factor on it. It feels like it was not professionally done, as there are so many grammar and spelling errors that may reflect the kind of company and service they might offer.
Capterra, the world’s leading software reviews and selection platform does not have a record of this tool on its website. This itself will give the customers an idea of how reliable Finder. Expert is.</p>

        <h2 id="findemails">FindEmails</h2>

        <p>### General Features</p>

        <p>FindEmails.com (formerly Toofr) is email finding software that offers sales and marketing tools, email security and verification, and speedy processing, among other features.

Many users also commented on its simple and easy-to-use user interface.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>It does not offer an integration with applications such as Google Sheets which is kind of a hassle when building a prospecting list. Although it boasts a 98% accuracy rate, still many users mentioned that they are still getting a lot of “unstable” emails.
There is neither a free trial nor a free version available on their website as of writing, so there is no way for you to check if this is the right tool for you before going for the paid plans. Most competitors offer this feature to new subscribers.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>As of writing, LeadMine’s website, https://www.leadmine.net  seems to be inaccessible. Its Chrome extension is called LeadMine Prospector, which might confuse its subscribers.
Many user reviews mentioned its very limited credits in the free trial and its very short trial. Only 10 free credits are given during the free trial period. This is less than the other email finders’ offering.</p>

        <h3 id="what-makes-you-like-it-">What makes you like it?</h3>

        <p>Pricing is its strongest sell-point. Unlike most email finders, EDT does not have a credit system. For S$9.99 per month, you will get unlimited searches and shell an extra S$5, and you will get unlimited email validation as well.
This is one of the most affordable among its competitors.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>The Chrome Extension is temporarily depreciated with the latest major patch. You have to use the Web App instead with full functionality:  http://app.emaildiscoverytool.com
If you checked on their Chrome extension, there are only 85 users of this tool. The number might mean something for you as a new subscriber, as fewer users would also mean fewer reviews and in general, would mean how popular this tool is in the market.
On the website, https://www.saasworthy.com/, EDT got only a ranking of 73% SW score, which is below most of the other email finders.
They do not provide an API.</p>

        <h2 id="sellhack">SellHack</h2>

        <p>### General Features</p>

        <p>SellHack is a platform built for business owners and sales professionals to automate their prospect list building.
It is an easy-to-use sales prospecting tool that searches available public sources to find someone’s email address. With only the prospect’s name and company domain, SellHack delivers verified email addresses with high accuracy.SellHack also has a browser extension that helps you build targeted lists so you can send cold emails to your leads. You can uncover your sales prospect’s previously hidden email addresses while searching their social profiles.
According to them, they have an industry-leading 12 step, real-time email verification engine that takes the guesswork out of finding the BEST email address for your prospect in just a few seconds.
The tool also has a bulk email verification option where you can easily upload your incomplete data files with ‘First Name’, ‘Last Name’ and ‘Company Name’ to find valid email addresses.</p>

        <h3 id="how-much-will-it-cost-you-">How much will it cost you?</h3>

        <p>With SellHack, billing can be Monthly or Yearly. Pricing is also separated into 2 categories: INDIVIDUAL and TEAM.
Let’s examine first the INDIVIDUAL pricing category. It has 4 plans available for its users.
Lite Plan, offers 100 credits and costs $5 a month with a basic plugin. A yearly subscription costs $3/month.
Basic Plan, offers 350 credits and costs $19 a month with a basic plugin. A yearly subscription costs $15/month.
Starter Plan, offers 1000 credits and costs $ 49 a month with an enhanced plugin. A yearly subscription costs $30/month.
Pro Plan, offers 2500 credits and costs $99 a month with an elite plugin, advanced list-builder full API access and Salesforce integration. A yearly subscription costs $60/month.
In TEAM category, subscription is either monthly or yearly and 4 options to choose from:
Team Starter is priced at $99 a month with 2500 credits with 5 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $60 per month (save $468).
Team Basic is priced at $249 a month with 5000 credits with 10 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $150 per month (save $1168).
Team Pro is priced at $499 a month with 10000 credits with 20 user seats/members on monthly billing. A yearly subscription costs $300 per month (save $2388).
Custom, a Build-to-Suit program depending on customer needs.</p>

        <h3 id="what-makes-you-like-it-">What makes you like it?</h3>

        <p>SellHack has a nice Chrome extension that stays on top so when I’m searching I can click on it from the pull-down and enter the data and copy/paste the results into my CRM.
It is so user-friendly and the interface is not too cluttered. Too often there are software programs that come as a service in there so jam-packed with materials that sometimes you can’t really make any sense of it.
Sellhack works best with LinkedIn. Sellhack deducts the credits only for verified emails. It has a Lead generating option with a beautiful dashboard.
Generally, it is less expensive than other similar software and they have good reviews on their customer services as well!</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>Although the algorithm is usually pretty accurate in terms of deliverable information, Sellhack is not 100% reliable. Emails offered can sometimes bounce back. In their Prospect List builder, you can only add a maximum number of prospects per day. For example, if you have the Basic plan, you can only add up to 200 prospects only in a given day. For inside sales- that deems an issue if you spend a day prospecting. There were some workarounds but were limited to LinkedIn policies- not SellHack.
As of now, SellHack provides only business emails. It doesn’t provide any phone numbers of the prospects.
Users can only have 10 free credits every month and for the paid subscriptions, unused credits will not roll over to the next month.</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>It seems that their accuracy is not at par with its competitors, as they do “guess- emails” also. However, you will not spend credits for this.</p>

        <p>There are issues regarding unsubscribing the plan. One user mentioned that he had difficulty in the process when he tried to unsubscribe.
The free trial credits are a bit low compared to some email finders. You might not be able to thoroughly “get the feel” of the application to actually move to paid subscription.</p>

        <h2 id="leadcrawler">LeadCrawler</h2>

        <p>### General Features</p>

        <p>Whenever you need only one “good” email address behind your target website or URL, LeadCrawler is a go-to tool.
With an intuitive interface, it’s quite easy to use. All you need to do is add your target URL to the search field and click “Submit.” In a few moments, there’ll appear the address available for your query. You can also upload a list of multiple URLs to speed things up and find emails in bulk.
1/6 of all websites out there use Cloudflare, which keeps owners’ contact details obfuscated. Unlike many other tools, LeadCrawler can bypass security and find hidden addresses.
Some people never ditch their personal emails tied to Yahoo, Gmail, and other freemails. They keep on using them for business purposes, that’s why this tool handles such cases too.
If the data is missing for the URL you submitted, LeadCrawler will check other pages on your target site and its official Facebook page. The social media lookup reportedly increases the number of successful email searches by 15%.</p>

        <h3 id="how-much-will-it-cost-you-">How much will it cost you?</h3>

        <p>LeadCrawler has four pricing plans for any budget you may have.
The Starter plan costs $29 per month and provides 1,5K credits for 15K email requests.
The Standard plan costs $49 per month and comes with 5K credits for 50K requests.
The Professional plan costs $99 per month and offers 20K credits for 200K requests.
The Enterprise plan costs $299 per month and gives access to 100K credits for 1M requests.
There’s also a free plan allowing new users to test the tool’s main features. While it has 1K credits on board, email addresses revealed for free are partially obscured.</p>

        <h3 id="what-makes-you-like-it-">What makes you like it?</h3>

        <p>According to their tests, LeadCrawler could find more emails than some other tools.
Also, they don’t store email addresses in their database, where they would get outdated. To provide you with timely and relevant data, the tool searches web pages for emails in real-time.
Whenever LeadCrawler can’t find anything, it returns a contact page as an alternative. That way, you’ll be able to reach out to your prospect via a contact form. Quite handy!</p>

        <h3 id="what-needs-improvement-">What needs improvement?</h3>

        <p>LeadCrawler is still on v1, so a lot more features could be added in the future if people need them (an API, email verification, etc.)
