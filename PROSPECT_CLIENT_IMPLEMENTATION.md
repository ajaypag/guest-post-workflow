# Prospect vs Client System Implementation

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Updated
- Added `client_type` field to clients table (default: 'client')
- Added `converted_from_prospect_at` timestamp field
- Added `conversion_notes` text field for tracking conversion details
- Created migration script at `/migrations/add-client-type.sql`

### 2. Dashboard Transformation
- Created new dashboard at `/app/bulk-analysis/page-new.tsx`
- Replaced old bulk analysis page with comprehensive dashboard
- Dashboard shows:
  - Quick stats (prospects, clients, projects, domains)
  - Filterable views (All/Prospects/Clients)
  - Prospect cards with conversion capability
  - Client table with quick actions

### 3. Service Layer Enhanced
- Updated `ClientService` with new methods:
  - `getProspects()` - Get prospects only
  - `getClientsOnly()` - Get clients only
  - `convertProspectToClient()` - Handle prospect conversion
- Modified `createClient()` to support client type

### 4. Feature Differentiation
**Prospects**:
- Limited to 2 active projects
- No workflow creation
- Sales team focus
- Quick conversion to client

**Clients**:
- Unlimited projects
- Full workflow access
- All features enabled
- Team collaboration

## How to Deploy

1. **Run Database Migration**:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/add-client-type.sql
```

2. **Replace Old Page**:
```bash
mv app/bulk-analysis/page.tsx app/bulk-analysis/page-old.tsx
mv app/bulk-analysis/page-new.tsx app/bulk-analysis/page.tsx
```

3. **Update Client Creation**:
When creating new clients, specify type:
```typescript
// Create prospect
await ClientService.createClient({
  name: "Potential Client Inc",
  website: "potential.com",
  clientType: "prospect",
  createdBy: userId
});

// Create client
await ClientService.createClient({
  name: "Signed Client Inc",
  website: "signed.com",
  clientType: "client",
  createdBy: userId
});
```

4. **Convert Prospect to Client**:
```typescript
await ClientService.convertProspectToClient(
  prospectId,
  "Signed contract on 2025-01-27"
);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Project Limits**: Implement 2-project limit for prospects
2. **Workflow Restrictions**: Block workflow creation for prospects
3. **Auto-Archive**: Add 90-day auto-archive for inactive prospects
4. **Analytics**: Add conversion tracking and metrics
5. **Permissions**: Restrict prospect access to sales team
