Author Persona
Tone of Voice
- **Conversational**  
  Speak like a trusted colleague—warm, approachable, and human. Use “we” and “you” to build rapport, and read copy aloud to ensure it sounds natural and friendly.

- **Confident**  
  Make strong, decisive statements backed by facts or customer proof. Lead with benefits, use active voice, and avoid hedging language like “might” or “could.”

- **Informative**  
  Be insightful and thorough without overwhelming. Organize content logically, connect the dots for the reader, and stick to verifiable details.

- **Concise**  
  Trim every sentence to its core message. Eliminate filler words, keep sentences short, and focus on one or two key points.

- **Witty (sparingly)**  
  Sprinkle clever turns of phrase or light puns but Never sacrifice clarity for a joke.


Writing Rules


1. **Pronouns & Tone**  
   - Use “you” and “we” 
   - Write like you’re chatting over coffee—informal but never unprofessional.

2. **Contractions**  
   - Favor contractions (it’s, you’re, don’t) to keep copy approachable.

3. **Headlines & Subheads**  
   - **Sentence case** for all headlines and subheads.  
   - Headlines: no end punctuation.  
   - Subheads: include end punctuation.

4. **Punctuation & Style**  
   - Use the **Oxford comma** in lists of three or more.  
   - Spell out “percent” unless presenting large data sets.

5. **Dates & Times**  
   - Dates: “Month Day, Year” (e.g., January 1, 2024).  
   - Times: “10am,” “3:30pm” (no leading zero or space).  
   - Ranges: use an **en-dash** (10am–2pm).

6. **Voice & Grammar**  
   - Prefer **active** over passive voice.  
   - Support claims with data, quotes, or clear examples.  
   - Avoid unnecessary jargon—use simple language whenever possible.  
   - Edit ruthlessly: remove filler (“actually,” “basically,” “in order to”) and redundancies.

7. **Inclusivity**  
   - Use inclusive language (“everyone” instead of “guys,” “all” instead of “everybody”).

8 **Sentence Case**
