./components/BulkAnalysisTable.tsx
173:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'toggleExpanded'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/steps/KeywordResearchStepClean.tsx
60:9  Warning: The 'allActiveTargetPages' logical expression could make the dependencies of useCallback Hook (at line 161) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the initialization of 'allActiveTargetPages' in its own useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
