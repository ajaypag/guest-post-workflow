### 🎯 Test Categories

#### 1. Current State Failures (`01-current-state-failures.spec.ts`)
**Purpose**: Document CURRENT BROKEN functionality
**Expected Result**: Tests FAIL and document specific issues

**Issues Documented**:
- ❌ Internal users blocked from `/internal/publishers` routes
- ❌ API endpoints returning 401 unauthorized for internal users  
- ❌ Missing publisher detail pages (`/internal/publishers/[id]`)
- ❌ Broken navigation links in internal layout
- ❌ No publisher creation workflow for internal users
- ❌ Missing publisher-website relationship management

#### 2. Ideal Future State (`02-ideal-future-state.spec.ts`)
**Purpose**: Define how functionality SHOULD work
**Expected Result**: Tests PASS when issues are resolved

**Functionality Tested**:
- ✅ Complete publisher management dashboard
- ✅ Publisher CRUD operations
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Publisher verification workflows
- ✅ Website-publisher relationship management
- ✅ Offering management
- ✅ Analytics and reporting

#### 3. Specific Scenarios (`03-specific-scenarios.spec.ts`)
**Purpose**: Test complex multi-step workflows

**Scenarios Covered**:
- 🔄 Complete publisher onboarding (create → connect website → add offering → verify)
- 🔄 Bulk publisher verification processes
- 🔄 Website ownership transfer workflows
- 🔄 Conflict resolution for disputed websites
- 🔄 Performance monitoring and suspension workflows
- 🔄 Comprehensive reporting and analytics

#### 4. Security Tests (`04-security-tests.spec.ts`)
**Purpose**: Verify access controls and security model

**Security Areas**:
- 🔒 Authentication requirements and session management
- 🔒 Authorization by user type (internal vs publisher vs account)
- 🔒 API security (CSRF protection, input validation)
- 🔒 Data access controls and audit logging
- 🔒 Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- 🔒 Secure error handling

## Test Infrastructure

### Page Object Models
- **Reusable**: Clean abstractions for UI interactions
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update when UI changes
- **Reliable**: Consistent element locators and wait strategies

### Test Data Management
- **Isolated**: Each test uses fresh, unique data
- **Cleaned**: Automatic cleanup prevents data pollution
- **Realistic**: Test scenarios mirror real-world usage

### Database Helpers
- **Safe**: All operations use test-specific data prefixes
- **Efficient**: Bulk operations and transaction management
- **Verifiable**: Built-in verification methods

## How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all internal publisher management tests
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:current    # Document current issues
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:future     # Test target functionality
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:scenarios  # Test complex workflows
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:security   # Test security model

# Generate comprehensive report
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:report
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Document current state (expect failures)
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:current

# 2. Implement fixes based on documented issues

# 3. Validate fixes work
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:future

# 4. Test complex workflows
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:scenarios

# 5. Verify security model
npm run test:e2e:internal-publisher:security
```

## Expected Test Results

### Current State (Immediate)
When run against the current codebase:

```
❌ CURRENT ISSUES DOCUMENTED:
- Publisher layout blocks internal users
- API endpoints reject internal users (401)
- Missing publisher detail pages (404)
- Broken navigation links
- No creation workflow
- Missing relationship management

✅ WORKING AREAS:
- Basic authentication and login
- Internal layout navigation structure
- Database connectivity
```

### Future State (After Implementation)
When all issues are resolved:

```
✅ ALL FUNCTIONALITY WORKING:
- Complete publisher management interface
- Full CRUD operations for publishers
- Working website-publisher relationships
- Verification workflows functional
- Search and analytics working
- Security model properly implemented
```
