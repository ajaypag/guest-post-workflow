# Production Database Migration Test Results

**Test Date**: 2025-08-23
**Database Backup**: pg-dump-postgres-1755992650.dmp
**Test Database**: test_production_migrations

## Migration Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Already Applied in Production
1. **Migration 0056**: Production LineItems Migration - ALREADY APPLIED
2. **Migration 0057**: Line Item Changes Schema Fix - ALREADY APPLIED (ran again, skipped existing)
3. **Migration 0058**: Update Line Item Changes Schema - ALREADY APPLIED
4. **Migration 0059**: Fix Line Item Changes Columns - ALREADY APPLIED

### ‚úÖ Successfully Applied in Test
1. **Migration 0060**: Add Target URL Matching - SUCCESS (columns already existed, migration recorded)
2. **Migration 0067**: Add User Curation to Bulk Analysis - SUCCESS (all 6 columns added)

### ‚ùå Failed Migrations
1. **Migration 0061**: Fix Inclusion Status Defaults - FAILED
   - Error: column "inclusion_status" does not exist
   - This column appears to not be part of your production schema

## Detailed Findings

### Line Items System (0056)
- Status: Already migrated in production
- order_line_items table has all required columns
- Data migration from orderGroups: 0 new items (already done)

### Target URL Matching (0060)
- Columns already existed: suggested_target_url, target_match_data, target_matched_at
- Migration was not recorded in migrations table, now recorded
- No schema changes needed

### User Curation (0067)
- Successfully added all 6 columns:
  - user_bookmarked (BOOLEAN, default: false)
  - user_hidden (BOOLEAN, default: false)
  - user_bookmarked_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - user_hidden_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - user_bookmarked_by (UUID, FK to users)
  - user_hidden_by (UUID, FK to users)
- All indexes created successfully

### Inclusion Status Issue (0061)
- The `inclusion_status` column doesn't exist in production
- This migration should be SKIPPED or modified
- May not be needed for your production system

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Create a Modified Migration Script** that:
   - Skips migrations 0056, 0057, 0058, 0059 (already applied)
   - Records migration 0060 (schema already exists)
   - Applies migration 0067 (user curation)
   - EXCLUDES migration 0061 (inclusion_status doesn't apply)

2. **Simplified Production Script**:
```sql
-- Only apply what's actually needed
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Record 0060 if not already recorded
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM migrations WHERE name = '0060_add_target_url_matching') THEN
        INSERT INTO migrations (name) VALUES ('0060_add_target_url_matching');
    END IF;
    
    -- Apply 0067 user curation
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM migrations WHERE name = '0067_add_user_curation_to_bulk_analysis') THEN
        -- Run migration 0067 here
    END IF;
END $$;
```

### Additional Discoveries

1. **Migration 0068** exists in production but not in our branch
   - Name: 0068_fix_publisher_migration_issues
   - This was likely added directly to production

2. **Order Groups to Line Items Migration**
   - Already complete in production
   - 0 items needed migration (confirms it was done previously)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ User curation features (bookmarks/hide) are ready to deploy
2. ‚úÖ Target URL matching infrastructure is already in place
3. ‚ùå Skip inclusion_status migration (not applicable)
4. üìù Only migration 0067 actually needs to be applied to production

## Testing Commands Used

```bash
# Restored backup to test database
cat db-backups/pg-dump-postgres-1755992650.dmp | docker exec -i guest-post-latest pg_restore -U postgres -d test_production_migrations

# Ran consolidated migrations
cat migrations/consolidated_marketing_branch_migrations.sql | docker exec -i guest-post-latest psql -U postgres -d test_production_migrations

# Verified results
docker exec -i guest-post-latest psql -U postgres -d test_production_migrations -c "SELECT name FROM migrations ORDER BY name;"
```

## Conclusion

The production database is more up-to-date than expected. Only the user curation feature (Migration 0067) needs to be applied. The inclusion_status migration should be removed from the deployment plan as it doesn't match the production schema.
