# Bulk Actions Test Summary

## Current State
The bulk actions functionality in LineItemsReviewTable should be working correctly:

### ✅ Component Setup
- Checkbox selection for individual items
- "Select All" checkbox in table header
- Bulk action buttons appear when items are selected
- Selected count display

### ✅ Available Bulk Actions
When items are selected, these buttons appear:
1. **Include All** - Sets all selected items to "included"
2. **Save for Later** - Sets all selected items to "saved_for_later"
3. **Exclude All** - Sets all selected items to "excluded"
4. **Clear Selection** - Deselects all items

### ✅ Pages Where It Works
1. **`/orders/[id]/review`** (External clients)
   - Has `onChangeStatus` handler ✅
   - Has `canChangeStatus: true` permission ✅
   - Bulk actions should work

2. **`/orders/[id]/internal`** (Internal team)
   - Has `onChangeStatus` handler (after our fix) ✅
   - Has `canChangeStatus: true` permission ✅
   - Bulk actions should work

### ❌ Pages Where It Doesn't Apply
- **`/orders/[id]`** (Main view page)
  - View-only, no editing functionality
  - No bulk actions needed

## How Bulk Actions Work
1. Select items using checkboxes
2. Bulk action bar appears showing "X items selected"
3. Click a bulk action button (Include All, Exclude All, etc.)
4. The `handleBulkStatusChange` function loops through selected items
5. Calls `onChangeStatus` for each selected item
6. Updates the database via API
7. Clears selection after completion

## Potential Issues to Watch
- No loading state during bulk operations
- No confirmation dialog for bulk exclude
- Operations are sequential, not batched (could be slow for many items)

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/orders/[id]/review` or `/orders/[id]/internal`
2. Select multiple items using checkboxes
3. Click bulk action buttons
4. Verify status changes in the dropdown for each item
5. Check that selection clears after action
