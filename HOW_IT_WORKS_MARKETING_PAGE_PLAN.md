## Phase 5: 5-Dimensional AI Qualification (The Secret Sauce)

### 1. Topical Overlap Analysis
- **Direct**: Already ranks for your specific niche terms
- **Related**: Ranks for relevant industry topics
- **Both**: Perfect match (direct + related)
- **None**: No meaningful overlap

### 2. Direct Authority Strength
- **Strong**: Positions 1-30 (pages 1-3) for your exact keywords
- **Moderate**: Positions 31-60 (pages 4-6)
- **Weak**: Positions 61-100 (pages 7-10)

### 3. Related Authority Strength
- Same analysis for broader/related topics
- Shows general industry authority even without exact matches

### 4. Topic Scope Assessment
- **Short Tail**: Can rank for broad industry terms
- **Long Tail**: Needs simple modifiers (geo, "best")
- **Ultra Long Tail**: Needs very specific niche angles

### 5. Evidence-Based Reasoning
- Direct keyword count & median position
- Related keyword count & median position
- Concrete evidence for human audit trail

**Key Messaging**:
- "This is contextual analysis - does THIS site make sense for THIS client?"

## Phase 6: Intelligent Status Assignment & Expert Review
**Section Headline**: "Pre-Qualified Recommendations, Not Database Dumps"
**Internal Team Perspective**: *"Human expertise validates AI reasoning before client sees anything"*

**Status Categories Explained**:
- **High Quality**: Direct overlap + Strong/Moderate authority = "These will work"
- **Good Quality**: Direct but weak OR Related but strong = "These can work with right approach"
- **Marginal Quality**: Some overlap but weak signals = "Possible but challenging"
- **Disqualified**: No meaningful overlap = "We filter these out for you"

**Key Messaging**:
- "Expert review ensures AI reasoning makes sense"
- "You only see sites that passed both AI and human qualification"
- "No time wasted reviewing irrelevant sites"

---

## Phase 7: Client Review - You See Only Pre-Qualified Sites
